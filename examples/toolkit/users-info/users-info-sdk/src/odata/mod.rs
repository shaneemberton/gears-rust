//! `OData` filter field definitions for `user_info` resources.
//!
//! This gear defines the filterable fields for each resource exposed by the
//! `user_info` gear. These field enums are used for type-safe `OData` filter
//! construction and validation.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! These types are primarily used by:
//! - REST API layer for `OpenAPI` schema generation
//! - Infrastructure layer for mapping to database columns
//! - Client code for type-safe filter construction
//!
//! ## Feature Gate
//!
//! This gear requires the `odata` feature to be enabled.
