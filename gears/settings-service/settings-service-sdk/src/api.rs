// Created: 2026-08-12 by Constructor Tech
//! The client traits consuming gears bind through `ClientHub`.
//!
//! # Error contract
//!
//! Every fallible method returns [`CanonicalError`], the platform-wide error
//! type — never a settings-specific one. That keeps the boundary uniform across
//! every gear SDK and means a new failure mode here is not a breaking change
//! for consumers.
//!
//! For flat typed dispatch see [`crate::SettingsError`], an opt-in projection
//! that lives beside these traits rather than inside them.
//!
//! # `watch` is deliberately absent
//!
//! The reader trait is specified with a fourth method, `watch`, for consumers
//! that have already *materialized* a value — a connection pool, a listening
//! socket — and will never re-read it unless told it changed. It is not
//! declared here yet.
//!
//! Declaring it means fixing the notification and acknowledgement payloads, and
//! those belong to Settings Activation, whose consumer-activation requirement is
//! still an open design gap: registration of interest, identifier-only payloads,
//! delivery-until-confirmed, and the per-apply account of who confirmed are all
//! unspecified. Types invented here would be redefined when that design lands —
//! which breaks implementors exactly as adding the method later would, only
//! silently, by changing what the payloads mean rather than failing to compile.
