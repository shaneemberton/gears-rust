//! GTS resource types this gear attributes its errors to, and the GTS schemas
//! the gear publishes.
//!
//! The resource types below also leave this crate as authorization-label stubs
//! (submitted next to the setting-type base, published with the gear's
//! manifest), so a role-definition that names one of them resolves. A stub
//! registers the identifier and constrains nothing: it does not describe the
//! category, the declaration or the stored value. They are
//! the values that reach `NotFound.ctx.resource_type` and its
//! siblings. They are the discriminator the [`crate::SettingsError`] projection
//! uses to tell two otherwise identical `NotFound` outcomes apart: a setting
//! that was never declared, and a secret-backed setting whose credential is not
//! configured at any scope. A consumer that conflates the two hands a
//! placeholder to its backend believing it to be a credential.

/// The abstract base every setting key derives from, as a wire string.

/// The schema of the abstract base every concrete setting type derives from.
///
/// Published with the gear's manifest: the submission below, to this crate's
/// collector (`gts_declarations()`), happens at link time, and the runtime
/// publishes the collector through the gear's `gts_publication(...)` and waits
/// for its admission before any application `init` — so the base exists before
/// any declaration path composes a derived type from it. No call is made from
/// this gear's init, and there is nothing to retry. The process-wide inventory
/// an embedded types registry drains at its own init gets the same entry.
///
/// A concrete setting is a type `SETTING_TYPE_BASE<vendor>.<package>.<category>.<name>.vN~`
/// derived from this base, narrowing `payload` to the value type its
/// declaration names — which is what lets an authorization policy name one
/// setting, or a wildcarded subtree of settings, as a resource. `payload` is
/// deliberately unconstrained here so that a derived type may narrow it to
/// **any** shape, scalar or object. The Schema Default is **not** here and not
/// in any derived type: it lives in the declaration's `default_value` alone, so
/// registration never gives it a second home.

// # Why the resource types are published as stubs
//
// The permission catalogue names these types as `resource_type`, and the
// platform role-definition validator resolves a rule's target type through the
// types registry, so each must be registered. What is registered is an
// authorization label, not the shape of the resource: the registry lets a
// published type only be widened in place and gives publishers no ordering, so
// a body that tracked the gear's representations would differ between two
// builds of the gear, and the older build (a rollback, a restart in the middle
// of a rollout) would be refused at publication and would not start. A stub is
// the same document in every build, so its publication is always a repeat.

/// The body published under a resource type: an authorization label.
///
/// Draft-07, `type: object` and nothing else — no `properties`, no `required`,
/// no `additionalProperties`. The key set and every value are fixed by
/// `type_id` and `title`, so every build of the gear publishes the same
/// document.
