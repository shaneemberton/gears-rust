// @cpt-dod:cpt-cf-settings-service-dod-category-management-authorization:p1
//! The authorization enforcement point.
//!
//! Every handler that touches a settings resource obtains its [`AccessScope`]
//! here first. The scope is not advisory: it is the query and visibility
//! predicate the handler applies, so a caller entitled to part of the tree
//! cannot read past it by asking differently.
//!
//! # Failing closed is structural, not a policy this module applies
//!
//! The platform's `PolicyEnforcer` returns `Result<AccessScope, EnforcerError>`
//! — an explicit deny, an unreachable decision point, and an unusable set of
//! constraints are all `Err`. There is no path that yields a scope without a
//! positive decision, so a handler cannot proceed on an unknown verdict by
//! forgetting a check: it has nothing to proceed *with*.
//!
//! What this module adds is the projection of that failure into the gear's own
//! error vocabulary, and the guarantee that **every** failure shape denies. A
//! new `EnforcerError` variant must be handled here or the match stops
//! compiling.
//!
//! # A handler can only ask for a listed permission
//!
//! The platform enforcer takes a resource type and an action as free values.
//! The gear does not hand it out: [`PermissionEnforcer`] owns it in a private
//! field, and its one method, [`PermissionEnforcer::access_scope`], takes a
//! [`Permission`]. That wrapper is what the gear stores and what every handler
//! and service receives, so the only question any of them can put to the
//! policy decision point is one of the rows of [`Permission`].
