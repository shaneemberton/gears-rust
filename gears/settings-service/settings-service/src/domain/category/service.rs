//! Category operations.
//!
//! Generic over the repository rather than holding a trait object: the
//! repository's methods are generic over [`DBRunner`] so the same code runs on
//! a connection and inside a transaction, and a generic method cannot be part
//! of an object-safe trait. The cost is a type parameter; the benefit is that
//! every operation below can run in a transaction when its caller needs one.
