//! Field-violation vocabulary for `422` responses.
//!
//! ADR 0005 keeps these constants beside the code that emits them so the wire
//! string and its meaning cannot drift apart. Each is the `code` a consumer sees
//! in the problem document's field-level `errors` array, and each is part of the
//! contract: an administrator's tooling matches on the code, never on `message`.

/// The whole request body, when a violation cannot be pinned to one field.
