//! Tests for the gear scaffold's startup contract.
//!
//! `Gear::init` needs a live `GearCtx` (database capability, config provider),
//! so its happy path belongs to the integration suite. What is pinned here is
//! the part that must hold before any of that: the gear must not hand out
//! resources it has not acquired.

    // Returning a default here instead of an error is exactly the failure the
    // fail-closed bootstrap exists to prevent, one layer up.
    let gear = SettingsService::default();
