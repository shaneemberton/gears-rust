//! Uniform single-flight gate for the hierarchy-integrity check.
//!
//! Both backends (`Postgres` + `SQLite`) coordinate via a primary-key
//! INSERT into `integrity_check_runs`. The PK is a synthetic singleton
//! (`id = 1`, enforced by a CHECK constraint) so the table holds at
//! most one row at a time: a second worker attempting to insert
//! receives a unique-violation, which this gear maps to
//! [`DomainError::IntegrityCheckInProgress`]. The `Postgres`
//! `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` path used by the legacy raw-SQL
//! integrity check is intentionally not reintroduced — uniform
//! behaviour across backends is the whole point of the Rust-side
//! refactor.
//!
//! ## Three-transaction lifecycle (per-call)
//!
//! The acquire INSERT and release DELETE run in their own short,
//! committed transactions, separate from the snapshot/work
//! transaction in between. This makes the lock row visible to
//! contenders for the duration of the check: a concurrent worker
//! attempting [`acquire_committed`] sees the committed row and
//! surfaces [`DomainError::IntegrityCheckInProgress`] instead of
//! queueing on the uncommitted PK and then succeeding after the
//! original transaction commits its INSERT+DELETE pair — the
//! same-tx INSERT+DELETE pattern was the way contender races used
//! to silently degrade into redundant runs.
//!
//! ## Stale-lock cleanup
//!
//! The acquire path deletes any row whose `started_at` is older than
//! [`MAX_LOCK_AGE`] before inserting its own row. This is intentional:
//! stale rows are by construction crashed workers, so reclaiming them
//! eagerly during any acquire keeps the table size bounded without
//! needing a separate sweeper. There is no separate periodic sweeper
//! because every `acquire_committed` call already runs the cleanup.
//!
//! ## Tx-level helpers
//!
//! [`acquire`] / [`release`] operate inside an existing
//! `DbTx<'_>` and remain available for tests; production code paths
//! use [`acquire_committed`] / [`release_committed`].
//!
//! ## Interim implementation
//!
//! Single-replica safe. Multi-replica gap: no fence-in-tx, no renewal
//! heartbeat, no attempts counter. Migration to toolkit-coord tracked
//! at <https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-rust/issues/1873>.
