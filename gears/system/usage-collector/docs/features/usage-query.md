## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

Provides the single, PDP-authorized read path into the metering substrate through one Query Gateway that serves both the aggregated path (`POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` with mandatory time range, a mandatory single Metric filter, and a mandatory aggregation operator, pushing server-side SUM / COUNT / MIN / MAX / AVG with grouping into the active storage plugin) and the raw path (`GET /usage-collector/v1/records?$filter=...&$orderby=...&$top=...&cursor=...` with mandatory time range expressed as `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` inside `$filter`, optional OData narrowing predicates over the `UsageRecordFilterField` enum, toolkit `CursorV1` continuation decoded and validated at the gateway, and `$top` bounded by the page-size cap). The `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` accepts the caller's `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` (resolved upstream by the ToolKit gateway on REST as `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated via `OperationBuilder::authenticated()`, or supplied verbatim by the in-process caller on the SDK trait surface where `UsageCollectorClientV1` methods take `ctx: &SecurityContext` as their first parameter) and authorizes every read through the per-component `authz_scope` helper wrapping `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` fail-closed; user-supplied filters are composed with PDP-returned constraints so the authorized scope can only narrow, both `active` and `inactive` `usage_records` within that scope are returned, and the gateway fails closed on missing SecurityContext, PDP, or plugin unavailability — the write path lives in `cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-usage-emission`.

**Consistency posture (read-after-write).** This feature's read surfaces (aggregated, raw, and the catalog reads they consult) inherit the gear-level consistency floor recorded in `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-consistency-contract` (ADR-0011) and DESIGN [§3.10.8](../DESIGN.md#3108-consistency-contract): a record `Acknowledged` by the ingestion path MAY be invisible to a subsequent aggregated query, raw query, or catalog read for an indeterminate window. **There is no read-your-writes guarantee against this feature**, and **no monotonic-reads-per-`(tenant_id, metric_gts_id)` guarantee** — a record observed on one page or one aggregation MAY be missing from a later page or window against a different replica. Source-gear flows that need same-request outcome (admission control, post-emit summary, immediate-readback dashboards) MUST consume the ingestion ack from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-usage-emission`, not this feature. Near-real-time observers poll within `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-latency` and accept lag bounded by the active plugin's published profile (`plugin-spi.md` §"Consistency profile"); consumers that need a tighter bound consciously couple to a specific plugin's ceiling.

### 1.2 Purpose

This feature exists so that downstream consumers (billing, dashboards, quota enforcers, tenant administrators) have a single, contract-stable read surface for usage data whose authorization posture is identical to the rest of the metering substrate — the per-component `authz_scope` helper invocation against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` returns the PDP decision and constraint set fail-closed on the inbound `SecurityContext`, the metric-lifecycle Metrics Catalog projection deterministically validates the mandatory single-Metric reference on the aggregated path without round-tripping the Plugin SPI per query, the usage-emission-owned `usage_records` table is consumed read-only (deactivation transitions remain owned by §2.5 Event Deactivation), and aggregation and raw record retrieval are delegated through the contract-stable Plugin SPI so the read shape is uniform regardless of the operator-selected storage backend. The Query Gateway refuses to widen scope under any user-supplied filter, rejects unregistered Metric references with an actionable error envelope before plugin dispatch, returns an empty result set / page (not an error) on empty matches within the authorized scope, and preserves auditable history by returning both `active` and `inactive` rows within that scope.

**Requirements**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-query-aggregation`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-query-raw`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-ownership`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-lifecycle`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-latency`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-freshness`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-workload-isolation`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-authorization`

**Principles**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pdp-centric-authorization`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`

| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer` | Any authenticated system that queries usage data through the public read surfaces (billing engines, quota enforcers, dashboards, downstream analytics) — submits aggregated reads via `POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` (typed `AggregationRequest` body) or `SdkClient` aggregated-read operations, and raw reads via `GET /usage-collector/v1/records` with OData query parameters (`$filter`, `$orderby`, `$top`, `cursor`) or `SdkClient` raw-read operations through the Query Gateway; subject to PDP authorization on every call per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-authorization`, with the PDP-returned `PdpConstraint` set composed into the parsed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` under intersection-only (narrowing) semantics; the SDK trait deliberately excludes Metric catalog management per `sdk-trait.md` §Out of scope, so Metric existence validation on the aggregated path flows through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-metric-lifecycle-catalog-kind-lookup` against the Metrics Catalog projection rather than through a separate SDK call |
| `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin`   | Tenant administrator who queries raw and aggregated usage data scoped to their own tenant via the same `POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` (body) and `GET /usage-collector/v1/records` (OData) paths (or the SDK equivalents); tenant isolation is enforced once by the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) and surfaced into the Query Gateway as a `PdpConstraint` set that narrows the authorized scope to the operator's tenant; cross-tenant reads are possible only when the platform PDP explicitly permits them (e.g., parent → subtenant hierarchies) per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-ownership`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### 1.5 Explicit Non-Applicability

- **UX** (`UX-FDESIGN-001` user journey, `UX-FDESIGN-002` accessibility): Not applicable because the usage-query feature is a backend read surface (`POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` and `GET /usage-collector/v1/records` plus the in-process SDK aggregated and raw read operations routed through the same Query Gateway); there is no human-facing UI in this gear, the only direct consumers are authenticated downstream systems (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer`) and tenant administrators traversing the public read surfaces (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin`), and any UI surfacing of usage data is delivered downstream by billing engines, dashboards, and analytics products outside this feature's scope. Developer experience on the read contract is encoded through the canonical `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` error envelopes, the toolkit `CursorV1` opaque continuation token (decoded and validated at the gateway via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against`), and the `$top` bounded page size published by `usage-collector-v1.yaml` and `sdk-trait.md`.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

User-facing interactions that start with an actor (human or external system) and describe the end-to-end flow of a use case. Each flow has a triggering actor and shows how the system responds to actor actions.

### Query Aggregated

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-query-query-aggregated`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer`

**Success Scenarios**:

- An authenticated usage consumer submits an aggregated read (via `POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` with an `AggregationRequest` body, or via the SDK `query_usage_aggregated` operation routed through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway`) carrying a mandatory `time_range`, a mandatory single Metric filter (`metric_gts_id`), a mandatory `aggregation` operator (`SUM` / `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` per the `AggregationFunction` enum in `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), and optional `group_by` keys; `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-attribution-and-pdp-authorization-on-read` resolves the caller into a `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` and binds the `(cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision, cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint set)` envelope to the request, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter` validates the single Metric reference against the metric-lifecycle Metrics Catalog projection via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-metric-lifecycle-catalog-kind-lookup`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` intersects the PDP constraint set with the user-supplied filters under intersection-only (narrowing) semantics, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2` invokes the Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` capability so the storage plugin executes the chosen aggregation and any `group_by` dimensions server-side, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-active-and-inactive-record-visibility` enforces that both `active` and `inactive` rows within the authorized scope contribute to the result, and the gateway returns a `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (`metric_gts_id`, `aggregation`, `buckets`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`.
- A tenant administrator (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin`) submits the same aggregated read scoped to their own tenant; the PDP-returned `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set narrows the authorized scope to the operator's tenant via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation`, no cross-tenant rows are aggregated absent an explicit platform PDP permit, and the gateway returns the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` over that narrowed scope.
- An empty match within the authorized scope returns an `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` with an empty `buckets` list per the Plugin SPI Method 3 contract — not an error envelope.

**Error Scenarios**:

- Request arrives without a resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` (REST handler did not receive `Extension<SecurityContext>` from ToolKit gateway middleware, or the SDK trait was invoked without a `ctx` argument) — whole-request rejection via the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; the collector never synthesizes identity per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` and no plugin dispatch occurs.
- PDP denies the read attribution tuple — whole-request rejection via the propagated platform-authorization `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="authz"`) from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize`; no plugin dispatch occurs per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.
- Mandatory `time_range` missing or structurally invalid — request-level structural validation `Problem` envelope (HTTP `400`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; no plugin dispatch occurs.
- Mandatory single Metric filter missing or supplied with more than one Metric — request-level rejection via the `Problem` envelope from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter` with `context.reason="kind_invariant"` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; OR the filter references a Metric that is not present in the in-process Metrics Catalog projection — request-level rejection via the same algorithm with `context.reason="unknown_metric"`; in either case without any fallback to a direct Plugin SPI catalog read per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.
- Mandatory `aggregation` operator missing or unsupported (not in the `AggregationFunction` enum `{SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG}` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` and `sdk-trait.md` Method 3) — request-level structural validation `Problem` envelope (HTTP `400`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; no plugin dispatch occurs.
- Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` returns `PluginUnavailable`, `Timeout`, `BackendError`, or `ContractViolation` — fail-closed `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; the gateway never synthesizes a partial aggregation result and never caches a prior decision per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - Caller submits an aggregated read — on REST through `POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` with an `AggregationRequest` body; the REST handler receives `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware (`OperationBuilder::authenticated()`) and W3C audit-correlation headers — or on the SDK through `UsageCollectorClientV1::query_usage_aggregated(ctx, ...)` with `ctx: &SecurityContext` as the first parameter per `sdk-trait.md` Method 3; the request carries mandatory `time_range`, mandatory single Metric filter (`metric_gts_id`), mandatory `aggregation` operator (`SUM` / `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` per the `AggregationFunction` enum in `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), optional `group_by` keys, and optional secondary filters (`tenant_id` / `resource` / `subject` / `source_gear` / `status`) - `inst-aggregated-request-received`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the REST handler receives no `Extension<SecurityContext>` (gateway middleware rejected the call upstream) or the SDK trait is invoked without a `ctx` argument **RETURN** the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` default response; the collector never synthesizes identity per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` - `inst-aggregated-missing-ctx`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Delegate PDP authorization to `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` via the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) for the read attribution tuple, receiving the `(cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision, cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint set)` envelope - `inst-aggregated-pdp-delegate`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the PDP decision is `deny` - `inst-aggregated-pdp-deny-branch`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the fail-closed platform-authorization `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="authz"`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` without any plugin dispatch (no cached decision per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-aggregated-pdp-deny-return`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-attribution-and-pdp-authorization-on-read` to bind the inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` and the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set to the validated request payload - `inst-aggregated-attribution`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the algorithm returns a fail-closed `Problem` envelope (missing SecurityContext, missing PDP envelope, or empty PdpConstraint set per `inst-attribution-fail-closed-check`), **RETURN** that envelope verbatim without any further processing per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` - `inst-aggregated-attribution-fail-return`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the request `time_range` is missing or structurally invalid, OR the mandatory `aggregation` operator is missing or unsupported (not in the `AggregationFunction` enum `{SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG}` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` and `sdk-trait.md` Method 3) - `inst-aggregated-structural-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the request-level structural validation `Problem` envelope (HTTP `400`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` without any plugin dispatch - `inst-aggregated-structural-return`
7. [ ] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter` against the request's mandatory single Metric filter — the algorithm delegates Metric existence lookup to `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-metric-lifecycle-catalog-kind-lookup` against the in-process Metrics Catalog projection - `inst-aggregated-metric-existence`
8. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the Metric-existence algorithm returns `arity-violation` (zero or more than one Metric in the filter) or `not-found` - `inst-aggregated-metric-existence-fail-branch`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the validation `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` — `context.reason="kind_invariant"` on arity violation; `context.reason="unknown_metric"` on `not-found` — without any plugin dispatch (no fallback to a direct Plugin SPI catalog read per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-aggregated-metric-existence-return`
9. [ ] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` to intersect the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set with the user-supplied filters (`group_by`, optional secondary filters) under intersection-only semantics; constraints can only narrow the authorized scope and MUST NOT widen it under any user-supplied input per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pdp-centric-authorization` - `inst-aggregated-constraint-composition`
10. [ ] - `p1` - **TRY** invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2` to dispatch the composed filter set, the mandatory `time_range`, the validated Metric handle, the chosen aggregation operator, and any `group_by` keys to the Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` capability against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records` (records originate from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-ingestion-gateway` and are consumed read-only here; ingestion semantics are owned by §2.3 Usage Emission); the plugin executes SUM/COUNT/MIN/MAX/AVG and any `group_by` dimensions server-side per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3 - `inst-aggregated-plugin-dispatch`
11. [ ] - `p1` - **CATCH** Plugin SPI transport, readiness, or contract error (`PluginUnavailable`, `Timeout`, `BackendError`, `ContractViolation`) - `inst-aggregated-plugin-catch`
    1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the fail-closed `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` while preserving the audit-correlation context propagated by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-audit-correlation` (no synthesized partial result per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-aggregated-plugin-catch-return`
12. [ ] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-active-and-inactive-record-visibility` to confirm both `active` and `inactive` rows within the authorized scope contribute to the result per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-lifecycle` (deactivation of `inactive` is owned by §2.5 Event Deactivation, not this feature) - `inst-aggregated-visibility-rule`
13. [ ] - `p1` - Assemble the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (`metric_gts_id`, `aggregation`, `buckets`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` and propagate the audit-correlation context via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-audit-correlation` - `inst-aggregated-result-assemble`
14. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (with an empty `buckets` list when no rows match within the authorized scope — not an error) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` - `inst-aggregated-return`

### Query Raw

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-query-query-raw`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer`

**Success Scenarios**:

- An authenticated usage consumer submits a raw read (via `GET /usage-collector/v1/records?$filter=...&$orderby=...&$top=...&cursor=...` with OData query parameters, or via the SDK `query_usage_raw` operation routed through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway`) where `$filter` is an OData predicate over `UsageRecordFilterField` carrying the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` time window plus optional narrowing predicates (`tenant_id` / `metric_gts_id` / `subject_id` / `subject_type` / `resource_id` / `resource_type` / `status`), `$orderby` projects the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)`, `$top` is bounded by the page-size cap, and `cursor` is an optional toolkit `CursorV1` continuation token; the gateway decodes and validates the cursor against the parsed `$filter` AST and `$orderby` projection via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` before any PDP or plugin work, enforces the semantic mandatoriness of the `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` time-range window after OData parsing and before plugin dispatch, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-attribution-and-pdp-authorization-on-read` resolves the caller into a `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` and binds the `(cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision, cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint set)` envelope to the request, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` AND-merges the PDP constraint set into the parsed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` under intersection-only (narrowing) semantics, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2` projects the validated cursor to the plugin keyset `(timestamp, id)`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2` invokes the Plugin SPI `query_usage_raw` capability with the structured tuple `(filter_ast, order_keys, page_after, limit)` bounded by `$top`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-active-and-inactive-record-visibility` enforces that both `active` and `inactive` rows within the authorized scope are returned, and the gateway mints the next `CursorV1` from `last_keyset` (when present) bound to the current `$filter` / `$orderby` and returns a `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` envelope with `@nextLink` cursor URL per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`.
- Pagination continues across multiple calls by passing the prior response's `@nextLink` cursor token verbatim into the next request's `cursor` query parameter; the gateway decodes the cursor on every subsequent call, validates it against the current `$filter` / `$orderby`, and re-issues a fresh `CursorV1` from the next `last_keyset`; the plugin SPI is opaque to the cursor wire format and never decodes the token; the gateway omits `@nextLink` on the final page.
- A tenant administrator (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin`) submits the same raw read scoped to their own tenant; the PDP-returned `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set narrows the authorized scope to the operator's tenant via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation`, no cross-tenant rows are returned absent an explicit platform PDP permit, and the gateway returns the `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` envelope over that narrowed scope.
- An empty match within the authorized scope returns a `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` with an empty `items` list (and no `@nextLink`) per the Plugin SPI Method 4 contract — not an error envelope.

**Error Scenarios**:

- Request arrives without a resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` (REST handler did not receive `Extension<SecurityContext>` from ToolKit gateway middleware, or the SDK trait was invoked without a `ctx` argument) — whole-request rejection via the canonical `Unauthenticated` `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; the collector never synthesizes identity per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` and no plugin dispatch occurs.
- PDP denies the read attribution tuple — whole-request rejection via the propagated platform-authorization `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="authz"`) from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize`; no plugin dispatch occurs per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.
- The supplied `cursor` fails `CursorV1` decode (malformed payload or version tag) — request-level rejection via the canonical `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="cursor_decode"`); no plugin dispatch occurs.
- The supplied `cursor` was minted against a different `$orderby` projection (or `$orderby` does not project the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)`) — request-level rejection via the canonical `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="order_mismatch"`); no plugin dispatch occurs.
- The supplied `cursor` was minted against a different `$filter` AST, OR the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` time window is missing from `$filter` — request-level rejection via the canonical `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="filter_mismatch"`); no plugin dispatch occurs.
- `$top` exceeds the bounded cap of 1,000 records per page declared by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing` — server-side clamping per the toolkit-odata convention OR a request-level rejection via the canonical `Problem` envelope per the OAS reference contract; either way no plugin dispatch happens with an out-of-cap limit.
- Plugin SPI `query_usage_raw` returns `PluginUnavailable`, `Timeout`, `BackendError`, or `ContractViolation` — fail-closed `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; the gateway never synthesizes a partial page and never caches a prior decision per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - Caller submits a raw read — on REST through `GET /usage-collector/v1/records?$filter=...&$orderby=...&$top=...&cursor=...` with OData query parameters; the REST handler receives `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware (`OperationBuilder::authenticated()`) and W3C audit-correlation headers — or on the SDK through `UsageCollectorClientV1::query_usage_raw(ctx, ...)` with `ctx: &SecurityContext` as the first parameter per `sdk-trait.md` Method 4; the request carries the `$filter` predicate over `UsageRecordFilterField` (mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` window plus optional narrowing predicates over `tenant_id` / `metric_gts_id` / `subject_id` / `subject_type` / `resource_id` / `resource_type` / `status` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), `$orderby` projecting the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)`, `$top` bounded by the page-size cap, and an optional `cursor` (toolkit `CursorV1`) - `inst-raw-request-received`

4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the PDP decision is `deny` - `inst-raw-pdp-deny-branch`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the fail-closed platform-authorization `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="authz"`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` without any plugin dispatch (no cached decision per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-raw-pdp-deny-return`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-attribution-and-pdp-authorization-on-read` to bind the inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` and the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set to the validated request payload - `inst-raw-attribution`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the algorithm returns a fail-closed `Problem` envelope (missing SecurityContext, missing PDP envelope, or empty PdpConstraint set per `inst-attribution-fail-closed-check`), **RETURN** that envelope verbatim without any further processing per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` - `inst-raw-attribution-fail-return`
6. [ ] - `p1` - Parse `$filter`, `$orderby`, and `$top` via toolkit-odata and clamp `$top` to the bounded cap of 1,000 records per page from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing` per the toolkit-odata convention; on unparseable OData expressions return the canonical `Problem` envelope (HTTP `400`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` without any plugin dispatch - `inst-raw-odata-parse`
7. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the parsed `$filter` AST does NOT contain the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` time-range window (semantic mandatoriness enforced by the usage-query algorithm at the gateway after OData parsing and before plugin dispatch — NOT by toolkit-odata) - `inst-raw-time-range-mandatory-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the canonical `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="filter_mismatch"`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` without any plugin dispatch - `inst-raw-time-range-mandatory-return`
8. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the request carries a `cursor` query parameter - `inst-raw-cursor-validate-branch`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2` to decode the `cursor` as a toolkit `CursorV1` value and validate it via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` against the parsed `$filter` AST and `$orderby` projection; on `Malformed` return the canonical `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="cursor_decode"`); on `OrderMismatch` return `Problem` (`context.reason="order_mismatch"`); on `FilterMismatch` return `Problem` (`context.reason="filter_mismatch"`); no plugin dispatch in any of these branches - `inst-raw-cursor-validate`
9. [ ] - `p1` - Invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` to AND-merge the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set into the parsed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` AST under intersection-only semantics; PDP constraints can only narrow the authorized scope and MUST NOT widen it under any user-supplied input per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pdp-centric-authorization`; the resulting AST is the single source of truth handed to the plugin SPI (no separate constraint envelope is forwarded) - `inst-raw-constraint-composition`
10. [ ] - `p1` - **TRY** invoke `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2` to dispatch the structured tuple `(filter_ast: FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>, order_keys: OrderKeys, page_after: Option<Keyset>, limit: u32)` to the Plugin SPI `query_usage_raw` capability against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records` (records originate from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-ingestion-gateway` and are consumed read-only here; ingestion semantics are owned by §2.3 Usage Emission) — the cursor wire format is NEVER forwarded to the plugin; the plugin returns `(rows: Vec<UsageRecord>, last_keyset: Option<Keyset>)` - `inst-raw-plugin-dispatch`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

Internal system functions and procedures that do not interact with actors directly. These are reusable building blocks called by Actor Flows or other processes.

### Attribution & PDP Authorization (Read Path)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-attribution-and-pdp-authorization-on-read`

**Input**: The inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` received at the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` boundary (on REST as `Extension<SecurityContext>` from ToolKit gateway middleware, on SDK as the `ctx: &SecurityContext` first argument), the `(cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision, cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint set)` envelope from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (invoked via the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside the query gateway), and the read request payload (aggregated or raw).

**Output**: An attributed read request that binds the resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` and the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set to the validated request payload, ready for downstream filter composition. The algorithm discriminates fail-closed outcomes by branch so the calling flow surfaces the correct §4 state and `Problem` envelope category: (a) missing resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` OR missing `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision` envelope (substrate unreachable / no decision available) yields a fail-closed `Problem` envelope routed to the `unavailable` state per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; (b) substrate returned `permit` without an accompanying `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set OR an empty constraint set (no permitted rows in any dimension) yields a fail-closed `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="authz"`) routed to the `denied` state per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`. In every fail-closed branch: no synthesized identity, no cached decision, no inferred result per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - Receive the inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` at the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` boundary — on REST as `Extension<SecurityContext>` from ToolKit gateway middleware, on SDK as the `ctx: &SecurityContext` first argument (the calling flow already exited fail-closed if `Extension<SecurityContext>` was absent on REST or `ctx` was absent on SDK per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-attribution-receive-secctx`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Receive the `(cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision, cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint set)` envelope from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (invoked via the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside the query gateway; the calling flow already exited fail-closed on PDP `deny` per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-attribution-receive-pdp`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` is missing, OR the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision` envelope is missing, OR the substrate returned `permit` without an accompanying `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set, OR the accompanying `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set is empty (no permitted rows in any dimension) - `inst-attribution-fail-closed-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` is missing OR the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision` envelope is missing (substrate unreachable / no decision available) — **RETURN** the fail-closed `Problem` envelope routed to the `unavailable` state per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` (no synthesized identity, no cached decision per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-attribution-fail-closed-substrate-return`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - **ELSE** (substrate returned `permit` without an accompanying `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set OR the constraint set is empty) — **RETURN** the fail-closed `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="authz"`) routed to the `denied` state per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` (PDP authorized no rows in the requested scope; no inferred result per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-attribution-fail-closed-return`
4. [ ] - `p1` - Bind the resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` and the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set to the validated request payload as an attributed read request, preserving the foundation-resolved tenant scope per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation` - `inst-attribution-bind`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Propagate the audit-correlation context via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-audit-correlation` so downstream filter composition and Plugin SPI dispatch preserve W3C tracing context for read-path observability - `inst-attribution-audit-correlation`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the attributed read request to the caller - `inst-attribution-return`

### Metric Existence Validation (Aggregated Filter)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter`

**Input**: The mandatory single Metric filter (`metric_gts_id`) from the `AggregationRequest` body (or the SDK `query_usage_aggregated` `AggregationQuery` shape per `sdk-trait.md`).

**Output**: A validated Metric handle ready for downstream `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2`. On arity violation (zero or more than one Metric in the filter), a validation `Problem` envelope with `context.reason="kind_invariant"` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` (the aggregated path description explicitly maps single-Metric arity violations to `kind_invariant`). On `not-found` from the catalog projection, a validation `Problem` envelope with `context.reason="unknown_metric"` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`. Metric lookup is delegated to `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-metric-lifecycle-catalog-kind-lookup`; this algorithm MUST NOT re-implement Metric lookup or dispatch the Plugin SPI for catalog reads per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - Parse the Metric filter from the validated `AggregationRequest` body (or the SDK `AggregationQuery` shape) - `inst-metric-existence-parse`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the Metric filter is absent, OR contains zero Metrics, OR contains more than one Metric (arity violation) - `inst-metric-existence-arity-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the validation `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="kind_invariant"`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` (single-Metric filter is mandatory for the aggregated path per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-query-aggregation`; arity violation is mapped to `kind_invariant` per the `/v1/records/aggregate` description in `usage-collector-v1.yaml`) - `inst-metric-existence-arity-return`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Delegate Metric existence lookup to `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-metric-lifecycle-catalog-kind-lookup` with the parsed `metric_gts_id` (the metric-lifecycle catalog-projection algorithm performs an in-process projection lookup only and MUST NOT dispatch the Plugin SPI per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-metric-catalog`) - `inst-metric-existence-delegate`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the catalog-kind-lookup returns `not-found` (the projection has no entry for this `gts_id`, or its cold-start refresh has not yet completed) - `inst-metric-existence-not-found-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the validation `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="unknown_metric"`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` without any fallback to a direct Plugin SPI catalog read per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` (cold-start unknown is treated identically to an absent entry per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-metric-lifecycle-catalog-kind-lookup`) - `inst-metric-existence-not-found-return`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the validated Metric handle (the `metric_gts_id` paired with the catalog-resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-metric-kind` and optional `unit`) for downstream `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2` - `inst-metric-existence-return`

### PDP Constraint Composition

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`

**Input**: The `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize`, the parsed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` AST from the raw read (or the typed user-supplied filters from the aggregated `AggregationRequest` body — `metric_gts_id`, `tenant_id`, `resource`, `subject`, `source_gear`, `status`, plus optional `group_by`), and the resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` for tenant anchoring.

**Output**: A composed filter expression whose authorized scope is the intersection of the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set and the user-supplied filters. Composition is intersection-only: the gateway AND-merges PDP constraint predicates into the client filter AST (or the aggregated typed filter map). The resulting AST is the single source of truth handed to the plugin SPI — no separate constraint envelope is forwarded. Any user-supplied attempt to widen scope beyond a PDP constraint is clamped back to the constraint bound. No widening, no scope expansion under any user-supplied input per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pdp-centric-authorization`.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - Receive the parsed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` AST from the raw-read OData parser (or the typed user-supplied filter map from the aggregated `AggregationRequest` body) - `inst-constraint-composition-parse-user`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Parse the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set from the `(cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision, cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint set)` envelope returned by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` - `inst-constraint-composition-parse-pdp`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** constraint in the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set - `inst-constraint-composition-iterate`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - AND-merge the constraint predicate with the matching dimension in the parsed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` AST (or the aggregated typed filter map for `tenant_id`, `resource`, `subject`, `metric_gts_id`, `source_gear`, `status`); when no matching user-supplied predicate exists for that dimension, append the constraint predicate as-is so the authorized scope is narrowed by the constraint alone; when a user-supplied predicate exists on a dimension that has NO matching PDP constraint, the user-supplied predicate is preserved as-is (PDP imposed no bound on that dimension) - `inst-constraint-composition-intersect`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** any user-supplied predicate attempts to widen scope beyond a `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` bound (e.g. requesting a tenant outside the PDP-permitted tenants, or a Metric outside a PDP-permitted Metric set) - `inst-constraint-composition-widen-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Narrow the user-supplied predicate back to the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` bound (no widening permitted under any user-supplied input per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pdp-centric-authorization`; the clamp is silent on the wire and observable only in the narrowed result scope, never as a `Problem` envelope) - `inst-constraint-composition-clamp`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the composed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` AST (or the composed aggregated typed filter map) anchored on the resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` for downstream Plugin SPI dispatch (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2` or `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2`) — the AST is the single source of truth; no separate constraint envelope is forwarded - `inst-constraint-composition-return`

### Plugin SPI Aggregate Dispatch

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2`

**Input**: The composed filter set from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`, the mandatory `time_range`, the validated Metric handle from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter`, the chosen aggregation operator (`SUM` / `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG`), and any optional `group_by` keys.

**Output**: A `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (`metric_gts_id`, `aggregation`, `buckets`) returned by the Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` capability per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3 — the plugin executes the chosen aggregation and any `group_by` dimensions server-side using its native acceleration structures, bounded by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing` (≤ 100,000 rows over a 90-day single-tenant window with ≤ 2 groupings). On `PluginUnavailable` / `Timeout` / `BackendError` / `ContractViolation`, a fail-closed `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`. Versioned `-v2` to capture the `entry_type`-aware aggregation contract introduced by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-adr-usage-compensation` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-usage-compensation`; supersedes the prior `plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch` algorithm which assumed an `entry_type`-blind row set.

**Aggregation rule (locked; encoded in the dispatch request and honoured by the plugin per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3)** — `SUM(value)` is computed across both `entry_type = usage` and `entry_type = compensation` rows treating `value` as a signed quantity, so `SUM` is the **signed net total** per `(tenant_id, metric_gts_id)` group: compensation rows reduce the running counter total. `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG` operate over `entry_type = usage` rows only — `entry_type = compensation` rows are excluded from these four aggregations before they are computed. **Compensation entries adjust SUM; they are not events.** Counting a compensation as an event would double-count the original usage event (the compensation's referenced `usage` row is already counted); including a compensation's strictly-negative `value` in `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` would corrupt extremes (a refund would always become the new `MIN`) and corrupt means (the arithmetic mean would drift below the observed usage range). Status filtering applies before aggregation per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-data-lifecycle-active-inactive` — deactivated rows of any `entry_type` are excluded from every aggregation; the `active`-status filter and the `entry_type` filter are orthogonal. A negative `SUM(value)` is an ordinary aggregation outcome — the Usage Collector does NOT validate non-negative net and does NOT emit a negative-net detection signal per the un-policed-net stance in DESIGN §3.10.3; downstream consumers own any "net can't be negative" policy per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-downstream-usage-reader`.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - Assemble the Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` request (composed filter set, mandatory `time_range`, validated Metric handle, aggregation operator, optional `group_by` keys) per the contract published in `plugin-spi.md` Method 3; encode the aggregation rule (`SUM` nets across `entry_type ∈ {usage, compensation}`; `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` filter to `entry_type = usage` before aggregating) so the plugin executes the entry-type-aware operator server-side — the rule is part of the operator contract, not a post-filter applied at the gateway - `inst-aggregate-dispatch-assemble-v2`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **TRY** invoke the storage-plugin `aggregate_usage` capability via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records` — the plugin treats every filter as authoritative and MUST NOT widen the result set beyond the supplied filters, MUST honour the entry-type-aware aggregation rule (`SUM` nets `usage` + `compensation` signed; `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` over `usage` only), and executes the chosen operator plus any `group_by` dimensions server-side (fanning out per-row reads to the core is forbidden per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3) - `inst-aggregate-dispatch-try-v2`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **CATCH** Plugin SPI error (`PluginUnavailable`, `Timeout`, `BackendError`, `ContractViolation` per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3) - `inst-aggregate-dispatch-catch-v2`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the fail-closed `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` while preserving the audit-correlation context propagated by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-audit-correlation` (no synthesized partial result per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-aggregate-dispatch-catch-return-v2`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (with an empty `buckets` list when no rows match within the authorized scope — not an error per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3); a negative `SUM(value)` bucket is an ordinary aggregation outcome and MUST NOT be rewritten or rejected by the gateway per the un-policed-net stance in DESIGN §3.10.3 - `inst-aggregate-dispatch-return-v2`

### Plugin SPI Raw Page Dispatch

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2`

**Input**: The composed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` AST from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` (with the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` time-range predicate folded in plus optional narrowing predicates over `tenant_id` / `metric_gts_id` / `subject_id` / `subject_type` / `resource_id` / `resource_type` / `status`), the parsed `OrderKeys` projection over the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)`, the optional `page_after: Option<Keyset>` projected from the validated `CursorV1` by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2`, and the `limit: u32` clamped to `$top` ≤ 1,000 records per page per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing`.

**Output**: A `(rows: Vec<UsageRecord>, last_keyset: Option<Keyset>)` tuple returned by the Plugin SPI `query_usage_raw` capability per `plugin-spi.md` Method 4 — the plugin emits a `last_keyset` (the `(timestamp, id)` tuple of the final row of the page) when more pages remain, and omits it on the final page. The cursor wire format is NEVER forwarded to the plugin SPI; the plugin is opaque to the OData/cursor encoding. On `PluginUnavailable` / `Timeout` / `BackendError` / `ContractViolation`, a fail-closed canonical `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - Assemble the Plugin SPI `query_usage_raw` request as the structured tuple `(filter_ast: FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>, order_keys: OrderKeys, page_after: Option<Keyset>, limit: u32)` per the contract published in `plugin-spi.md` Method 4 (NEVER include the cursor wire format; the plugin is opaque to OData/cursor encoding) - `inst-raw-dispatch-assemble`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **TRY** invoke the storage-plugin `query_usage_raw` capability via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records` — the composed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` AST is authoritative; the plugin MUST honor every predicate without widening and MUST emit rows in the requested `OrderKeys` projection - `inst-raw-dispatch-try`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **CATCH** Plugin SPI transport, readiness, or contract error (`PluginUnavailable`, `Timeout`, `BackendError`, `ContractViolation` per `plugin-spi.md` Method 4) - `inst-raw-dispatch-catch`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the fail-closed canonical `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` while preserving the audit-correlation context propagated by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-foundation-audit-correlation` (no synthesized partial page per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`) - `inst-raw-dispatch-catch-return`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the `(rows: Vec<UsageRecord>, last_keyset: Option<Keyset>)` tuple to the gateway for cursor minting and envelope assembly (with an empty `rows` list and `last_keyset = None` when no rows match within the authorized scope — not an error per `plugin-spi.md` Method 4) - `inst-raw-dispatch-return`

### Cursor Pagination Orchestration

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2`

**Input**: The optional `cursor` query parameter from `GET /usage-collector/v1/records` (toolkit `CursorV1` opaque token, base64url-encoded), the parsed `$filter` AST (`FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>`), the parsed `$orderby` projection (`OrderKeys` over the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)`), the clamped `$top` limit, and the `(rows, last_keyset)` tuple returned by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2`.

**Output**: A two-phase cursor-pagination decision owned end-to-end by the gateway. Phase 1 (decode + validate): the gateway decodes the inbound `cursor` query parameter as a toolkit `CursorV1` value, then calls `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against($filter, $orderby)` to ensure the cursor was minted against the exact same parsed filter AST and order-key projection as the current request. On `Malformed` the gateway emits the canonical `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="cursor_decode"`) and transitions to `rejected-validation`; on `OrderMismatch` it emits `Problem` (`context.reason="order_mismatch"`); on `FilterMismatch` it emits `Problem` (`context.reason="filter_mismatch"`); the gateway also enforces the semantic mandatoriness of `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` after OData parsing and before plugin dispatch and rejects requests with the time-range window missing as `Problem` (`context.reason="filter_mismatch"`). On success the gateway projects the cursor to the plugin keyset `(timestamp, id)` and forwards a typed `page_after: Option<Keyset>` to the plugin SPI. Phase 2 (mint + emit): on a successful page return, the gateway mints the next `CursorV1` from the plugin-returned `last_keyset` (bound to the current `$filter` AST and `$orderby` projection) and embeds it in the `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` `@nextLink` URL; when `last_keyset = None`, the gateway omits `@nextLink` to signal the last page. The cursor is NEVER forwarded verbatim to the plugin SPI — the plugin is opaque to the OData/cursor wire encoding.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the request carries a `cursor` query parameter - `inst-cursor-orchestration-incoming-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Decode the `cursor` as a toolkit `CursorV1` value; on a malformed payload or version-tag mismatch **RETURN** the canonical `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="cursor_decode"`) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` without any plugin dispatch - `inst-cursor-orchestration-decode`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - Invoke `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against($filter, $orderby)` to confirm the cursor was minted against the exact same parsed filter AST and order-key projection as the current request; on `OrderMismatch` **RETURN** `Problem` (`context.reason="order_mismatch"`); on `FilterMismatch` **RETURN** `Problem` (`context.reason="filter_mismatch"`); no plugin dispatch in either branch - `inst-cursor-orchestration-validate`
   3. [ ] - `p1` - Project the validated cursor to the plugin keyset `(timestamp, id)` as a typed `page_after: Option<Keyset>` value - `inst-cursor-orchestration-project`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **ELSE** - `inst-cursor-orchestration-no-cursor-branch`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Dispatch with `page_after = None`, so the plugin starts from the first page of the authorized scope per `plugin-spi.md` Method 4 - `inst-cursor-orchestration-first-page`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Forward the typed `page_after` (or `None`) to `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2` (the cursor wire format is NEVER forwarded to the plugin SPI) and receive the `(rows, last_keyset)` tuple - `inst-cursor-orchestration-dispatch`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the plugin returned a `last_keyset` (`Some(Keyset)`) - `inst-cursor-orchestration-next-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Mint the next `CursorV1` from `last_keyset` bound to the current parsed `$filter` AST and `$orderby` projection per the toolkit-odata `CursorV1` contract; embed the minted cursor token in the `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` `@nextLink` URL so the next caller forwards it back into the same request shape (cursor is gateway-owned state minted on each page; cross-binding cursors are rejected by `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` as `FilterMismatch` / `OrderMismatch` on the next call) - `inst-cursor-orchestration-mint-next`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **ELSE** (`last_keyset = None`) - `inst-cursor-orchestration-no-next-branch`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Omit `@nextLink` from the response — the plugin signaled the last page per `plugin-spi.md` Method 4 - `inst-cursor-orchestration-omit-next`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` envelope (`items`, optional `@nextLink` containing the freshly minted gateway-owned `CursorV1`) - `inst-cursor-orchestration-return`

### Active & Inactive Record Visibility

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-active-and-inactive-record-visibility`

**Input**: The PDP-authorized scope (the composed filter set from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` anchored on the resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context`) and the candidate row set returned by the storage plugin (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2` for the aggregated path or `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2` for the raw path) against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records`.

**Output**: A visible row set in which both `active` and `inactive` rows within the PDP-authorized scope are returned per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-lifecycle` (raw path: each `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-usage-record` carries its `status` field per `plugin-spi.md` Method 4 and `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; aggregated path: both `active` and `inactive` rows contribute to the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` `buckets`). An empty match within the authorized scope returns an empty result set / page — never a `Problem` envelope. Deactivation of `active` → `inactive` is owned by §2.5 Event Deactivation and is NOT performed here.

**Steps**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - Receive the candidate row set returned by the storage plugin from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2` or `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2` - `inst-visibility-receive`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** row in the candidate row set - `inst-visibility-iterate`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - Include the row when its lifecycle state is `active` OR `inactive` within the PDP-authorized scope per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-lifecycle` (auditable history is preserved by surfacing both states; deactivation transitions remain owned by §2.5 Event Deactivation and are NOT performed in this feature) - `inst-visibility-include`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the visible row set is empty (no `active` or `inactive` rows matched within the PDP-authorized scope) - `inst-visibility-empty-check`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** an empty visible row set so the calling flow surfaces an empty `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` `buckets` list or an empty `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` `items` list per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` — empty match within the authorized scope is never a `Problem` envelope per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3 and Method 4 - `inst-visibility-empty-return`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the visible row set (both `active` and `inactive` rows within the PDP-authorized scope) to the calling flow for downstream assembly - `inst-visibility-return`

### Query Request Lifecycle State Machine

**States**: `received`, `ctx-accepted`, `pdp-authorized`, `filter-validated`, `plugin-dispatched`, `result-returned`, `rejected-validation`, `denied`, `unavailable`

**Initial State**: `received`

**Final States**: `result-returned`, `rejected-validation`, `denied`, `unavailable`

**Transitions**:

1. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `received` **TO** `ctx-accepted` **WHEN** the inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` is present at the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` boundary — on REST as `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware (`OperationBuilder::authenticated()`) for the inbound aggregated read or the inbound raw read, on SDK as the `ctx: &SecurityContext` first argument to `UsageCollectorClientV1::query_usage_aggregated(ctx, ...)` or `UsageCollectorClientV1::query_usage_raw(ctx, ...)` per `sdk-trait.md` Methods 3 and 4 — and the gateway proceeds with the read (the calling flow already exited fail-closed via `inst-aggregated-missing-ctx` / `inst-raw-missing-ctx` if the SecurityContext was absent) - `inst-state-query-ctx-accepted`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `ctx-accepted` **TO** `pdp-authorized` **WHEN** `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (invoked via the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) returns a `permit` `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision` paired with a non-empty `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set, and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-attribution-and-pdp-authorization-on-read` binds both to the request payload (mirrors `inst-aggregated-pdp-delegate` + `inst-aggregated-attribution` and `inst-raw-pdp-delegate` + `inst-raw-attribution`) - `inst-state-query-pdp-authorized`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `pdp-authorized` **TO** `filter-validated` **WHEN** the request passes structural OData parsing and post-parse validation AND — for the aggregated path only — the mandatory `aggregation` operator is present and supported (one of `{SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG}` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`) AND the mandatory `time_range` is present in the typed body AND `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter` returns a validated single-Metric handle via the metric-lifecycle catalog projection AND — for the raw path only — `$top` is clamped within the bounded cap from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing` AND the parsed `$filter` AST contains the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` window (semantic mandatoriness enforced by the usage-query algorithm at the gateway after OData parsing, NOT by toolkit-odata) AND the optional `cursor` (when present) decoded as toolkit `CursorV1` AND was validated by `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against($filter, $orderby)` via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2` AND `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` has AND-merged the PDP constraint set into the parsed `FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>` under intersection-only semantics (mirrors `inst-aggregated-structural-check`, `inst-aggregated-metric-existence`, `inst-aggregated-constraint-composition`, `inst-raw-odata-parse`, `inst-raw-time-range-mandatory-check`, `inst-raw-cursor-validate`, and `inst-raw-constraint-composition`) - `inst-state-query-filter-validated`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `filter-validated` **TO** `plugin-dispatched` **WHEN** the Plugin SPI capability accepts the composed request — `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2` invokes `aggregate_usage` for the aggregated path (mirrors `inst-aggregated-plugin-dispatch`) or `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2` invokes `query_usage_raw` for the raw path with the structured tuple `(filter_ast, order_keys, page_after, limit)` projected by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2` (mirrors `inst-raw-plugin-dispatch`; the cursor wire format is NEVER forwarded to the plugin SPI) — and returns the candidate row set per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3 and Method 4 - `inst-state-query-plugin-dispatched`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `plugin-dispatched` **TO** `result-returned` **WHEN** `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-active-and-inactive-record-visibility` confirms both `active` and `inactive` rows within the PDP-authorized scope contribute to the result per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-lifecycle` AND the gateway assembles either the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (mirrors `inst-aggregated-visibility-rule` → `inst-aggregated-result-assemble` → `inst-aggregated-return`) or the `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` envelope (mirrors `inst-raw-visibility-rule` → `inst-raw-page-assemble` → `inst-raw-return`); an empty match within the authorized scope still transitions here and returns an empty `buckets` list or an empty `items` list with no `next_cursor` — never a `Problem` envelope per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3 and Method 4 - `inst-state-query-result-returned`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `pdp-authorized` **TO** `rejected-validation` **WHEN** the request fails structural pre-checks after attribution binding — the aggregated path's mandatory `time_range` missing or invalid (mirrors `inst-aggregated-structural-check`), the aggregated path's mandatory `aggregation` operator missing or unsupported (not in `{SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG}` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` and `sdk-trait.md` Method 3; mirrors `inst-aggregated-structural-check`), the aggregated path's mandatory single-Metric filter missing / multi-valued / references an unregistered Metric per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter` (mirrors `inst-aggregated-metric-existence-fail-branch` → `inst-aggregated-metric-existence-return`), OR — for the raw path only — the OData `$filter` / `$orderby` / `$top` strings fail to parse (mirrors `inst-raw-odata-parse`), the parsed `$filter` AST is missing the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` window (mirrors `inst-raw-time-range-mandatory-check` — surfaced as `context.reason="filter_mismatch"`), or the optional `cursor` query parameter fails decode (`context.reason="cursor_decode"`) / `OrderMismatch` (`context.reason="order_mismatch"`) / `FilterMismatch` (`context.reason="filter_mismatch"`) when validated by `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2` (mirrors `inst-raw-cursor-validate`); the gateway surfaces the canonical `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` envelope (HTTP `400` for aggregated body-shape violations; `context.reason="kind_invariant"` / `context.reason="unknown_metric"` for aggregated Metric checks; `context.reason="cursor_decode"` / `context.reason="order_mismatch"` / `context.reason="filter_mismatch"` for raw OData / cursor / time-range mandatoriness checks) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` and no Plugin SPI dispatch occurs per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` (structural pre-checks run after PDP delegation per the flow ordering — there is no path from `received` directly to `rejected-validation`); `$top` above the bounded cap surfaces `toolkit_odata::Error::InvalidLimit` and lifts to the canonical `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` envelope (`Problem.type` = `InvalidArgument`, HTTP `400`) carrying a `field_violation` for `$top` with reason code `INVALID_LIMIT`; this Problem is produced by `toolkit-odata` upstream of the `UsageCollectorError`→canonical-error lift, so no Usage-Collector-specific `context.reason` discriminator is attached — distinguishing it from the cursor-lifecycle reasons (`cursor_decode`, `order_mismatch`, `filter_mismatch`) above per DESIGN §3.3 Error Envelopes - `inst-state-query-rejected-validation`
7. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `pdp-authorized` **TO** `rejected-validation` **WHEN** the inbound `cursor` query parameter on the raw path fails one of the three toolkit-cursor validation gates — `Malformed` (`context.reason="cursor_decode"`), `OrderMismatch` (`context.reason="order_mismatch"`), or `FilterMismatch` (`context.reason="filter_mismatch"`) — per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2` and the toolkit `CursorV1` adoption DoD; the gateway rejects the request with the canonical `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` envelope before any Plugin SPI dispatch (cursor decode + validate is gateway-owned per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership`; the plugin SPI is opaque to the OData/cursor wire format and never receives an invalid cursor) - `inst-state-query-rejected-validation-cursor`

10. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `received` **TO** `unavailable` **WHEN** the inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` is absent at the handler boundary — on REST the ToolKit gateway middleware did not populate `Extension<SecurityContext>` (mirrors `inst-aggregated-missing-ctx` and `inst-raw-missing-ctx`); on SDK the trait method was invoked without a `ctx` argument; the gateway surfaces the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` without any further processing and never synthesizes identity per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed` - `inst-state-query-unavailable-missing-ctx`

### FR: Aggregation Rule — SUM Nets, Others Usage Only

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-aggregation-sum-nets`

The system **MUST** surface the locked aggregation contract on the read path so downstream consumers can reason about counter totals with compensation applied: `SUM(value)` aggregates across both `entry_type = usage` and `entry_type = compensation` rows treating `value` as a signed quantity, so `SUM` is the **signed net total** per group (compensation rows reduce the running counter total); `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG` filter to `entry_type = usage` rows before aggregating. **Compensation entries adjust SUM; they are not events.** Counting a compensation as an event would double-count the original usage event (its referenced `usage` row is already counted); including a strictly-negative compensation `value` in `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` would corrupt extremes and means. Status filtering applies before aggregation — deactivated rows of any `entry_type` are excluded from every aggregation; the `active`-status filter and the `entry_type` filter are orthogonal. A negative `SUM(value)` is an ordinary aggregation outcome — the Usage Collector does NOT validate non-negative net and does NOT emit negative-net detection per the un-policed-net stance recorded in DESIGN §3.10.3; downstream consumers (billing, quota, FinOps) own any "net can't be negative" policy per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-downstream-usage-reader`. The rule is encoded in `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2` and honoured server-side by the storage plugin per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3.

### FR: Query Aggregation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-query-aggregation`

The system **MUST** expose `POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` (and the SDK `query_usage_aggregated` operation per `sdk-trait.md`) as the single contract-first aggregated read path, accept an `AggregationRequest` carrying a mandatory `time_range`, a mandatory single-Metric filter (`metric_gts_id`), a mandatory `aggregation` operator (`SUM` / `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` per the `AggregationFunction` enum in `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), and optional narrowing filters / `group_by` keys per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`, route every submission through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway`, and end the synchronous path with a server-side aggregation executed by the storage plugin through the Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` capability against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records` per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-query-aggregated` — surfacing a `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (`metric_gts_id`, `aggregation`, `buckets`) anchored on the PDP-narrowed scope of the resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context`, with an empty `buckets` list when no rows match (never a `Problem` envelope). The `entry_type`-aware aggregation contract — `SUM` nets `usage` + `compensation` signed; `COUNT`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`AVG` over `usage` only ("compensation entries adjust SUM; they are not events") — is governed by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-aggregation-sum-nets`.

The system **MUST** expose `GET /usage-collector/v1/records` with OData query parameters (`$filter`, `$orderby`, `$top`, `cursor`) — and the SDK `query_usage_raw` operation per `sdk-trait.md` — as the single contract-first raw read path; accept `$filter` as an OData predicate over `UsageRecordFilterField` that MUST include the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` window (semantic mandatoriness enforced at the gateway after OData parsing and before plugin dispatch; missing window → canonical `Problem` `context.reason="filter_mismatch"`), `$orderby` MUST project the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)` (otherwise canonical `Problem` `context.reason="order_mismatch"`), `$top` is capped at 1,000 records per page per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing` (server clamps or rejects per the toolkit-odata convention), and `cursor` is a toolkit `CursorV1` opaque token decoded and validated at the gateway via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` (decode failure → `cursor_decode`; cursor minted against a different `$filter` → `filter_mismatch`; cursor minted against a different `$orderby` → `order_mismatch`); route every submission through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` and end the synchronous path with a cursor-paginated page returned by the storage plugin through the Plugin SPI `query_usage_raw` capability invoked with the structured tuple `(filter_ast: FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>, order_keys: OrderKeys, page_after: Option<Keyset>, limit: u32)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records` per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-query-raw` — surfacing a `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` envelope (`items`, optional `@nextLink` containing the freshly minted gateway-owned `CursorV1` bound to the current `$filter` AST and `$orderby` projection) anchored on the PDP-narrowed scope, with an empty `items` list (and no `@nextLink`) when no rows match (never a `Problem` envelope) and a freshly minted `CursorV1` in `@nextLink` only when more pages remain.

### FR: Tenant Isolation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-tenant-isolation`

The system **MUST** derive tenant scope on every aggregated and raw read solely from the inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` and the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set returned by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` through the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`), refuse any caller-supplied filter that attempts to widen the authorized tenant scope (clamped silently to the PDP bound per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` — no widening permitted under any user-supplied input), and never return cross-tenant rows absent an explicit platform PDP permit — per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation`.

### FR: Data Ownership

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-data-ownership`

> **Primary owner**: [§2.1 Foundation](./foundation.md) (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-foundation-fr-data-ownership`) — `fr-data-ownership` is a cross-cutting governance FR anchored on PDP-mediated read and write boundaries across the entire gear (PRD §5.8). Foundation owns the substrate-level enforcement (ownership model, data-sharing boundaries, PDP authorization helper, tenant isolation). This DoD captures the read-path realization: Usage Query is listed here because it is the public read surface through which data-sharing constraints are exercised.

The system **MUST** honor caller-supplied `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-resource-ref` attribution exclusively as a query-filter dimension that is intersected with the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set under intersection-only semantics — the read path MUST NOT synthesize resource ownership, MUST NOT widen the PDP-authorized scope beyond a constraint bound under any user-supplied resource filter (clamped silently per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`), and MUST surface ownership-bearing rows only within the PDP-authorized scope produced by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize`.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`

### FR: Data Lifecycle — Active+Inactive Visibility

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-data-lifecycle-active-inactive`

The system **MUST** return BOTH `active` and `inactive` `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-usage-record` rows within the PDP-authorized scope on both the aggregated read path (both states contribute to the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` `buckets`) and the raw read path (each returned record surfaces its `status` field verbatim per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`) per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-data-lifecycle`. This feature MUST NOT perform the `active → inactive` flip — deactivation is owned by §2.5 Event Deactivation (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-event-deactivation`); the Query Gateway only surfaces the `status` value the storage plugin returns.

### NFR: Query Latency

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-nfr-query-latency`

The system **MUST** meet the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-latency` budget on both read paths — p95 latency under the documented canonical load envelope (30-day single-tenant aggregated query bracketed by the `usage_collector.query.latency` histogram per DESIGN §3.11) — by pushing aggregation and pagination into the storage plugin via the Plugin SPI (no per-row fan-out into the core per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3 and Method 4), gating every read with the per-component `authz_scope` helper invocation against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver` on the critical path without a results cache per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway`, and surfacing query timing metrics for SLO monitoring.

### NFR: Batch and Report Timing

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-nfr-batch-and-report-timing`

The system **MUST** enforce the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing` caps at `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` before any Plugin SPI dispatch — raw-query `page_size` bounded at 1,000 records per page (over a 24-hour window) per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`, and aggregation result bounded at 100,000 rows over a 90-day single-tenant window with ≤ 2 groupings — surfacing a request-level structural validation `Problem` envelope (HTTP `400`) when caps are violated and orchestrating cursor-based continuation via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2` for the raw path so callers can drain results within the documented page-cap window.

### NFR: Workload Isolation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-nfr-workload-isolation`

The system **MUST** isolate the read workload from the ingestion workload — `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` is the only read-side dispatch component and remains structurally separate from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-ingestion-gateway`, so a read-side load spike or plugin slowdown MUST NOT degrade ingestion throughput per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-workload-isolation`; query in-flight and outcome telemetry (`usage_collector.query.inflight`, `usage_collector.query.requests` per DESIGN §3.11) are surfaced separately from the ingestion telemetry families.

### NFR: Authorization

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-nfr-authorization`

The system **MUST** accept an inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` at both query entry points — on REST as `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware (`OperationBuilder::authenticated()`), on the SDK trait as `ctx: &SecurityContext` first parameter to `UsageCollectorClientV1::query_usage_aggregated` / `query_usage_raw` per `sdk-trait.md` Methods 3 and 4 — and obtain the `(cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision, cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint set)` envelope via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` invoked through the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` (`PolicyEnforcer::access_scope_with(ctx, ...)` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) on every aggregated and raw read before any Plugin SPI dispatch, never cache a prior PDP decision and never synthesize identity, and fail closed with the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope (missing `SecurityContext`) or the propagated platform-authorization `Problem` envelope (PDP unavailable or `deny`) per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-authorization`.

### Principle: Fail-Closed

The system **MUST** return the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope when the inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` is missing at the handler boundary (REST handler did not receive `Extension<SecurityContext>` from ToolKit gateway middleware, or the SDK trait was invoked without a `ctx` argument); and the `unavailable` outcome with the fail-closed `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` when PDP (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` invoked via the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) or the bound storage plugin (Plugin SPI `PluginUnavailable` / `Timeout` / `BackendError` / `ContractViolation` per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3 and Method 4) is unreachable on either read path; the gateway MUST NOT synthesize a partial aggregation, MUST NOT synthesize a partial page, MUST NOT cache a prior PDP decision, and MUST NOT infer identity per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-fail-closed`.

The system **MUST** implement `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-query-raw` end-to-end per DESIGN §3.6 — thread the caller through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-rest-api` (REST handler receiving `Extension<SecurityContext>` from ToolKit gateway middleware) or `cpt-cf-usage-collector-interface-sdk-client` (SDK trait `query_usage_raw(ctx, ...)` with `ctx: &SecurityContext` first per `sdk-trait.md` Method 4), `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` (which performs per-component PDP authorization via the `authz_scope` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`), `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-plugin-host`, and the bound storage plugin — narrowing user-supplied predicates with the PDP-returned `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set under intersection-only semantics, decoding and validating the optional toolkit `CursorV1` `cursor` query parameter against the parsed `$filter` AST and `$orderby` projection via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` at the gateway per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership` (the cursor wire format is NEVER forwarded to the plugin SPI; the gateway mints a fresh `CursorV1` from the plugin-returned `last_keyset` and embeds it in `@nextLink` when more pages remain), dispatching the structured tuple `(filter_ast, order_keys, page_after, limit)` to the Plugin SPI `query_usage_raw` capability, and clamping `$top` to the bounded cap per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing` prior to dispatch.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-query-query-raw`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-seq-query-raw`

**Touches**:

- API: `GET /usage-collector/v1/records`
- DB: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records`
- Entities: `CursorV1`, `Keyset`, `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>`

### Data: usage_records (read-only)

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-dbtable-usage-records`

The system **MUST** consume `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records` as a READER ONLY on both the aggregated and raw read paths — the sole writer is §2.3 Usage Emission (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-usage-emission`); this feature MUST NOT insert, update, or delete rows in `usage_records`, MUST NOT mutate the `status` column (`active → inactive` is owned by §2.5 Event Deactivation), and MUST honor the row shape declared by usage-emission per DESIGN §3.7 (every persisted column — `tenant_id`, `resource_id`, `resource_type`, optional `subject_id` / `subject_type`, `source_gear`, `metric_gts_id`, `value`, `timestamp`, `idempotency_key`, `metadata`, `status` — is surfaced verbatim through the Plugin SPI without rewriting or interpretation).

- Entities: `UsageRecord`

### Contract: Downstream Usage Reader

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-contract-downstream-usage-reader`

The system **MUST** honor the outbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-downstream-usage-reader` surface served by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` per DESIGN §3.5 Downstream Usage Reader Contract — downstream rating / billing / reporting / dashboard consumers depend on the documented REST and SDK request shapes (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-query`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-raw-query`), the documented result shapes (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result`, `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` for the raw read, toolkit `CursorV1` opaque continuation embedded in `@nextLink`), the PDP-narrowed scope semantics (filters can only narrow, never widen), the stable error categories (`rejected-validation` with reasons `cursor_decode` / `order_mismatch` / `filter_mismatch` / `unknown_metric` / `kind_invariant`, `denied`, `unavailable` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), and the active-and-inactive record visibility rule. Business logic (pricing, rating, invoice generation, quota enforcement) MUST NOT be performed inside the Usage Collector — it is the responsibility of the downstream reader.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-query-query-aggregated`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-query-query-raw`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-downstream-usage-reader`

### Entity: AggregationQuery

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-aggregation-query`

The system **MUST** treat `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-query` per DESIGN §3.1 — accept exactly one mandatory `metric_gts_id` filter (rejected with `context.reason="kind_invariant"` per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter` on arity violation), one mandatory `time_range`, a mandatory `aggregation` operator (`SUM` / `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` per the `AggregationFunction` enum in `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; missing or unsupported values are rejected before plugin dispatch as a structural validation `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), optional `group_by` keys, and optional caller-supplied narrowing filters (`tenant_id` / `resource` / `subject` / `source_gear` / `status` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` `AggregationRequest`) that MUST NOT widen the PDP-authorized scope under any user-supplied input (clamped silently per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`).

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-query-query-aggregated`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-query`

**Touches**:

- Entities: `AggregationQuery`

### Entity: AggregationResult

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-aggregation-result`

The system **MUST** treat `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` per DESIGN §3.1 — return aggregated counter / gauge `buckets` for the resolved PDP-authorized scope (anchored on the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context`), surface `metric_gts_id`, the chosen `aggregation`, and the `buckets` list verbatim from the storage plugin without business-logic transformation per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-constraint-no-business-logic`, and surface an empty `buckets` list (never a `Problem` envelope) when no rows match within the authorized scope per `plugin-spi.md` Method 3.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result`

**Touches**:

- Entities: `AggregationResult`

### Entity: RawQuery

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-raw-query`

The system **MUST** treat `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-raw-query` per DESIGN §3.1 — accept the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` time-range window expressed inside the `$filter` OData predicate (semantic mandatoriness enforced at the gateway after OData parsing and before plugin dispatch per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2`), an optional `cursor` query parameter (toolkit `CursorV1` opaque token decoded and validated at the gateway via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against`; never decoded by the plugin SPI), a bounded `$top` (≤ 1,000 records per page per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing`), `$orderby` projecting the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)`, and optional caller-supplied narrowing predicates over `UsageRecordFilterField` (`tenant_id` / `metric_gts_id` / `subject_id` / `subject_type` / `resource_id` / `resource_type` / `status` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`) that MUST NOT widen the PDP-authorized scope under any user-supplied input (clamped silently per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`).

**Implements**:

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-raw-query`

**Touches**:

- Entities: `RawQuery`

### Cursor: CursorV1 Gears Toolkit Adoption

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-cursor-v1-toolkit-adoption`

The system **MUST** adopt toolkit `CursorV1` as the raw-read continuation wire format and locate cursor decode + validation at the gateway per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership`:

- Cursor wire format is toolkit `CursorV1` (opaque to client, base64url-encoded, contains version tag + bound filter/order digest + keyset payload).
- The gateway decodes and validates the cursor against the current parsed `$filter` AST and `$orderby` projection via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` BEFORE any PDP or plugin work.
- Validation failures map to canonical `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` responses: `Malformed` → `rejected-validation { reason: cursor_decode }`; `OrderMismatch` → `rejected-validation { reason: order_mismatch }`; `FilterMismatch` → `rejected-validation { reason: filter_mismatch }`.
- The cursor is bound to the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)` and is NEVER decoded by the plugin SPI; the plugin receives only a typed `page_after: Option<Keyset>` projected from the validated cursor by the gateway.
- Existing entity-cursor-token semantics (opaque, single-use, server-minted) are preserved; what changes is the wire format (toolkit `CursorV1`) and the validation locus (gateway, not plugin).

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-usage-query-query-raw`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership`

**Touches**:

- API: `GET /usage-collector/v1/records`
- Entities: `CursorV1`, `Keyset`, `UsageRecordFilterField`

### Entity: PdpConstraint

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-pdp-constraint`

The system **MUST** consume `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` per foundation DESIGN — a read-only constraint envelope returned by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (invoked from `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` via the per-component `authz_scope` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) paired with the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-decision`, composed with the user-supplied filters under intersection-only semantics per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` such that user-supplied filters MUST NOT widen the authorized scope under any user-supplied input (any widening attempt is silently clamped back to the constraint bound per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-pdp-centric-authorization`).

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`
- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-attribution-and-pdp-authorization-on-read`

- Entities: `PdpConstraint`

### Entity: SecurityContext

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-security-context`

The system **MUST** consume `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` per foundation DESIGN — the platform-resolved caller-identity envelope accepted at the two convention-bound entry points (on REST as `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware via `OperationBuilder::authenticated()`; on the SDK trait as `ctx: &SecurityContext` first parameter to `UsageCollectorClientV1::query_usage_aggregated(ctx, ...)` / `query_usage_raw(ctx, ...)` per `sdk-trait.md` Methods 3 and 4) — as the SOLE source of tenant scope on both read paths; `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` MUST anchor every PDP-constraint composition (via the per-component `authz_scope` helper against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) and every Plugin SPI dispatch on this inbound context, MUST NOT synthesize or infer identity, and MUST NOT widen the authorized tenant scope under any user-supplied filter per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation`.

### Entity: ResourceRef

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-resource-ref`

The system **MUST** consume `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-resource-ref` per DESIGN §3.1 — caller-supplied resource attribution (`resource_id` / `resource_type`) honored exclusively as a query-filter dimension intersected with the PDP-authorized scope under `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2` — never as a basis for widening the PDP-authorized scope; any user-supplied `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-resource-ref` outside the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` bound is silently clamped back to the constraint bound.

**Implements**:

- `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`

**Constraints**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-resource-ref`

**Touches**:

- Entities: `ResourceRef`

### API: POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-api-post-records-aggregate`

The system **MUST** expose `POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` and DESIGN §3.3 — with the REST handler receiving `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware (`OperationBuilder::authenticated()`) and delegating to `UsageCollectorClientV1::query_usage_aggregated(ctx, ...)` per `sdk-trait.md` Method 3 — accept an `AggregationRequest` (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-query`), validate the mandatory single-Metric filter via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter` against the metric-lifecycle `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-metric-catalog` projection through `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-metric-lifecycle-catalog-kind-lookup` (rejecting `arity-violation` with `context.reason="kind_invariant"` and `not-found` with `context.reason="unknown_metric"`), validate the mandatory `time_range` and the mandatory `aggregation` operator (one of `{SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG}` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; missing or unsupported values yield a structural validation `Problem` envelope before any plugin dispatch), perform per-component PDP authorization via the `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` realizing `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`, dispatch the composed filter set + `time_range` + validated Metric handle + aggregation operator + `group_by` keys to the Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` capability via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2`, and return either a `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` or one of the stable `rejected-validation` / `denied` / `unavailable` `Problem` envelopes (missing `SecurityContext` at the handler boundary surfaces the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope per the yaml's `default` response).

### API: GET /usage-collector/v1/records

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-api-post-records-query`

The system **MUST** expose `GET /usage-collector/v1/records` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml` and DESIGN §3.3 with the OData query parameters `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$top`, `cursor` (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-raw-query`) — with the REST handler receiving `Extension<SecurityContext>` populated by ToolKit gateway middleware (`OperationBuilder::authenticated()`) and delegating to `UsageCollectorClientV1::query_usage_raw(ctx, ...)` per `sdk-trait.md` Method 4; parse and validate the OData expressions, enforce the semantic mandatoriness of `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` inside `$filter` at the gateway after OData parsing and before plugin dispatch (missing window → canonical `Problem` `context.reason="filter_mismatch"`), require `$orderby` to project the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)` (otherwise `context.reason="order_mismatch"`), clamp `$top` to the bounded cap of 1,000 records per page per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing`, decode the optional `cursor` query parameter as a toolkit `CursorV1` value and validate it via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` against the parsed `$filter` AST and `$orderby` projection (`Malformed` → `cursor_decode`; `OrderMismatch` → `order_mismatch`; `FilterMismatch` → `filter_mismatch`) per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-cursor-pagination-orchestration-v2`, perform per-component PDP authorization via the `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` realizing `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`, dispatch the structured tuple `(filter_ast: FilterNode<UsageRecordFilterField>, order_keys: OrderKeys, page_after: Option<Keyset>, limit: u32)` to the Plugin SPI `query_usage_raw` capability via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-raw-page-dispatch-v2` (the cursor wire format is NEVER forwarded to the plugin SPI), mint the next `CursorV1` from the plugin-returned `last_keyset` bound to the current `$filter` / `$orderby`, and return either a `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` envelope (with an optional `@nextLink` containing the freshly minted gateway-owned `CursorV1`) or one of the stable `rejected-validation` / `denied` / `unavailable` canonical `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` envelopes (missing `SecurityContext` at the handler boundary surfaces the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope per the yaml's `default` response).

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### 6.1 Endpoints Summary

The feature's REST surface is aligned with the phase-03 OAS reference contract (`usage-collector-v1.yaml`) and the phase-04 DESIGN.md §3.3 Endpoints Overview table. The runtime OAS is emitted at runtime by `OpenApiRegistryImpl` from `OperationBuilder` calls; the YAML is the documentary reference enforced by the CI drift-check.

| Operation                   | Method | Path                                    | OperationId                                | Tag   |
| --------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Raw read (cursor-paginated) | `GET`  | `/usage-collector/v1/records`           | `usage_collector.query_raw_records`        | Query |
| Aggregated read (body)      | `POST` | `/usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` | `usage_collector.query_aggregated_records` | Query |

Query parameters for the raw read: `$filter` (OData predicate over `UsageRecordFilterField`; mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` window), `$orderby` (MUST project canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)`), `$top` (clamped to `[1, 1000]` per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-batch-and-report-timing`), `cursor` (toolkit `CursorV1` opaque token decoded and validated at the gateway via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership`).

Response envelope for the raw read: `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` (`items`, optional `@nextLink`). Response for the aggregated read: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (typed body; no `@nextLink`, no pagination — see aggregate-asymmetry rationale at `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-aggregate-asymmetry`).

### 6.2 Behavioural Criteria

- [ ] `p1` - A well-formed aggregated read by an authorized caller through `POST /usage-collector/v1/records/aggregate` (or the SDK `query_usage_aggregated` operation per `sdk-trait.md`) carrying a structurally valid `[from, to)` `time_range`, exactly one `metric_gts_id` filter that resolves through the metric-lifecycle Metrics Catalog projection, and a mandatory `aggregation` operator drawn from `{SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG}` produces a `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (`metric_gts_id`, `aggregation`, `buckets`) computed server-side by the Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` capability against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dbtable-usage-records`; aggregated queries that omit the `time_range`, carry zero / more than one `metric_gts_id`, or omit / supply an unsupported `aggregation` operator are rejected with a structured `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="kind_invariant"` on Metric-arity violation; HTTP `400` for missing `time_range` or missing / unsupported `aggregation`) before any Plugin SPI dispatch (aggregated success and pre-dispatch validation per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-query-aggregation` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-api-post-records-aggregate`).
- [ ] `p1` - A well-formed raw read by an authorized caller through `GET /usage-collector/v1/records` (or the SDK `query_usage_raw` operation per `sdk-trait.md`) carrying a structurally valid `$filter` over `UsageRecordFilterField` that includes the mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` window, optional narrowing predicates (`tenant_id` / `metric_gts_id` / `subject_id` / `subject_type` / `resource_id` / `resource_type` / `status` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), `$orderby` projecting the canonical keyset `(timestamp, id)`, a `$top` within the 1,000-records-per-page cap, and an optional toolkit `CursorV1` continuation token in the `cursor` query parameter returns a `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` envelope (`items`, optional `@nextLink` containing a freshly minted gateway-owned `CursorV1`) deterministically resumable across calls by forwarding the prior response's `@nextLink` cursor token back into the next request; a malformed cursor surfaces as the canonical `toolkit_canonical_errors::Problem` envelope with `context.reason="cursor_decode"`, a cursor minted against a different `$orderby` surfaces with `context.reason="order_mismatch"`, and a cursor minted against a different `$filter` (or a missing mandatory `timestamp ge X and timestamp lt Y` window) surfaces with `context.reason="filter_mismatch"` (cursor decode + validate at the gateway via `toolkit_odata::validate_cursor_against` per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership`; the plugin SPI never receives the cursor wire format) and the request leaks no records (raw pagination success and cursor-V1 adoption per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-query-raw`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-cursor-v1-toolkit-adoption`, and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-api-post-records-query`).
- [ ] `p1` - Every aggregated and raw read composes the foundation-returned `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set with the caller's request filters under intersection-only semantics via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`; any caller-supplied filter that attempts to widen scope beyond a constraint bound (e.g., a tenant outside the PDP-permitted tenants or a Metric outside a PDP-permitted Metric set) is silently clamped back to the constraint bound and the effective query never broadens the PDP-authorized scope under any input — verifiable by exercising a widening attempt and observing that the returned row set is bounded by the PDP constraint, not the caller's filter (PDP narrowing per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-principle-pdp-centric-authorization` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-data-ownership`).
- [ ] `p1` - An aggregated query whose `metric_gts_id` is absent from the in-process Metrics Catalog projection — or whose cold-start refresh has not yet completed — is rejected before any Plugin SPI dispatch via `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-metric-existence-on-aggregated-filter` with a precise, actionable `Problem` envelope (`context.reason="unknown_metric"`) citing the missing `metric_gts_id`; the gateway MUST NOT fall back to a direct Plugin SPI catalog read on the latency-critical hot path, MUST NOT return a partial result, and MUST surface the same envelope for cold-start unknowns as for fully absent entries (Metric existence validation per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-api-post-records-aggregate`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-aggregation-query`, and the metric-lifecycle catalog projection).
- [ ] `p1` - When the inbound `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` is missing at the handler boundary (REST handler did not receive `Extension<SecurityContext>` from ToolKit gateway middleware, or the SDK trait was invoked without a `ctx` argument) the gateway returns the canonical `Unauthenticated` `Problem` envelope; when `cpt-cf-usage-collector-flow-foundation-pdp-authorize` (invoked via the per-component `authz_scope` helper inside `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` against `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-authz-resolver`) returns `deny` / yields an empty `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set / is unreachable, or the Plugin SPI `aggregate_usage` / `query_usage_raw` capability returns `PluginUnavailable` / `Timeout` / `BackendError` / `ContractViolation`, the gateway returns the corresponding fail-closed `Problem` envelope per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`; in every case the gateway never synthesizes a partial aggregation or partial page, never caches a prior PDP decision, never synthesizes or infers identity, and surfaces zero records — verifiable by injecting each failure mode independently and observing the corresponding `Problem` envelope (fail-closed posture per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-principle-fail-closed` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-nfr-authorization`).
- [ ] `p1` - Every aggregated and raw read derives `tenant_id` exclusively from the foundation-resolved `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-security-context` and the PDP-returned `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-pdp-constraint` set; cross-tenant reads are impossible absent an explicit platform PDP permit, no caller-supplied `tenant_id` filter or header escapes the `SecurityContext` binding (any widening attempt is silently clamped per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-pdp-constraint-composition-v2`), and a tenant-administrator caller observes only rows scoped to their own tenant — verifiable by issuing a query with a caller-supplied `tenant_id` outside the resolved `SecurityContext` and confirming the returned scope is clamped back to the PDP-permitted tenants (tenant isolation per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-tenant-isolation` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-security-context`).
- [ ] `p1` - Within the PDP-authorized scope, both `active` and `inactive` `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-usage-record` rows are visible to query callers — both states contribute to the aggregated `buckets` and each raw record surfaces its `status` field verbatim — and the Query Gateway never filters rows by activation state, never performs the `active → inactive` flip (deactivation is owned by §2.5 Event Deactivation per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-event-deactivation`), and never overrides the `status` value returned by the storage plugin (active-and-inactive visibility per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-data-lifecycle-active-inactive` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-active-and-inactive-record-visibility`).
- [ ] `p1` - An authorized aggregated or raw query whose filters match zero rows within the PDP-authorized scope returns an empty `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result` (`buckets` is the empty list) or an empty `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>` envelope (`items` is the empty list and `@nextLink` is omitted); zero matches MUST NOT surface as an HTTP `404`, an error envelope, a Plugin SPI error, or any non-200 outcome — verifiable by issuing a filter that is known to match nothing and confirming a `200 OK` with an empty payload (empty-match semantics per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-query-aggregation`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-query-raw`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-entity-aggregation-result`, and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-cursor-v1-toolkit-adoption`).
- [ ] `p1` - Every accepted aggregated and raw read honours the downstream usage-reader contract surface served by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-component-query-gateway` per DESIGN §3.5 Downstream Usage Reader Contract — the documented request shapes (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-query`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-raw-query`), the documented response shapes (`cpt-cf-usage-collector-entity-aggregation-result`, `toolkit_odata::Page<UsageRecord>`, toolkit `CursorV1`), the stable error categories (`rejected-validation` with reasons `cursor_decode` / `order_mismatch` / `filter_mismatch` / `unknown_metric` / `kind_invariant`, `denied`, `unavailable` per `usage-collector-v1.yaml`), the gateway-owned cursor decode + validate guarantee per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-principle-cursor-gateway-ownership`, the PDP-narrowed scope semantics, and the active-and-inactive record visibility rule — and surfaces values verbatim from the storage plugin without business-logic transformation (no pricing, rating, invoice generation, quota enforcement, unit conversion, currency conversion, or rule-based filtering); any deviation surfaces as a contract-test failure against `usage-collector-v1.yaml` (downstream contract per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-contract-downstream-usage-reader` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-constraint-no-business-logic`).
- [ ] `p1` - `SUM` over a `(tenant_id, metric_gts_id)` group that contains both `entry_type = usage` rows and `entry_type = compensation` rows MUST equal the **signed net total** — `SUM(value)` aggregates across both `entry_type` values treating `value` as a signed quantity so compensation rows reduce the running counter total; verifiable by emitting a `usage` row with `value = +10`, a `compensation` row with `value = -3` whose `corrects_id` references the `usage` row, and observing `SUM(value) = +7` on the aggregated read. The same construction with a single `usage` row and no compensations MUST yield `SUM(value) = +10` (unchanged); compensation rows whose referenced `usage` row has been deactivated (and which therefore cascaded to `inactive` per the depth-1 cascade owned by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-event-deactivation`) MUST NOT contribute to `SUM` (`SUM` returns to `0` after the cascade) — the `active`-status filter is applied before the `entry_type`-aware aggregation (SUM-nets contract per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-aggregation-sum-nets` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-algo-usage-query-plugin-spi-aggregate-dispatch-v2`).
- [ ] `p1` - `COUNT` over the same `(tenant_id, metric_gts_id)` group that contains a `usage` row and a `compensation` row MUST equal **1** — counting `compensation` rows as events would double-count the original usage event because the compensation's referenced `usage` row is already counted; `MIN(value)`, `MAX(value)`, and `AVG(value)` over the same group MUST be computed over the `entry_type = usage` rows only — including the strictly-negative compensation `value` would corrupt extremes (the refund would become the new `MIN`) and means (the mean would drift below the observed usage range). Verifiable by adding a `compensation` row with `value = -3` to a group with a single `usage` row of `value = +10` and confirming `COUNT = 1`, `MIN = +10`, `MAX = +10`, `AVG = +10` (compensation excluded from all four aggregates) (usage-only aggregation per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-aggregation-sum-nets`).
- [ ] `p1` - The aggregation contract is orthogonal to status filtering: deactivated rows of any `entry_type` (whether the row was directly deactivated as a `usage` row, deactivated as a `compensation` row, or flipped to `inactive` via the depth-1 cascade owned by `cpt-cf-usage-collector-feature-event-deactivation`) MUST be excluded from all five aggregations (`SUM` / `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG`) before netting / counting / extremes / means are computed; verifiable by deactivating either the `usage` row or one of its referencing `compensation` rows and confirming that the post-cascade `SUM` returns to a state consistent with the remaining `active` rows in the group while `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `AVG` likewise reflect only the remaining `active` `entry_type = usage` rows (orthogonality of `active` filtering and `entry_type` filtering per `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-aggregation-sum-nets` and `cpt-cf-usage-collector-dod-usage-query-fr-data-lifecycle-active-inactive`).
