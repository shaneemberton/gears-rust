//! `ConversionRequest` repository contract.
//!
//! [`ConversionRepo`] is the sole storage seam the conversion domain
//! layer touches. It abstracts the `SeaORM`-backed implementation
//! (`crate::infra::storage::repo_impl::conversion`) so
//! [`crate::domain::conversion::service::ConversionService`] can be
//! unit-tested against a pure in-memory fake
//! (`crate::domain::conversion::test_support::FakeConversionRepo`).
//!
//! Trait-method shape notes:
//!
//! * Every write path that participates in a larger saga (closure
//!   re-materialization on approval, `tenants.self_managed` flip) is
//!   expressed as a single repo method that performs only its
//!   `conversion_requests` write. Saga-level wiring (TX boundary, closure
//!   updates, audit emission) lives in the service layer that arrives
//!   later in this plan.
//! * The `transition_pending_to_*` methods perform an atomic guarded
//!   `UPDATE` that fences on `status = 0 AND deleted_at IS NULL`. On
//!   zero rows updated the implementation re-reads the current row to
//!   distinguish [`DomainError::NotFound`] from
//!   [`DomainError::AlreadyResolved`].
//! * `query_expired` and `soft_delete_resolved_older_than` carry the
//!   background reaper / retention contract; both are batched and
//!   tolerate empty result sets.
