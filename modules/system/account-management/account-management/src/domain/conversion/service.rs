//! `ConversionService` — domain orchestrator for the dual-consent
//! `pending -> {cancelled, rejected, expired, approved}` lifecycle of a
//! [`ConversionRequest`].
//!
//! This phase implements five of the six service methods:
//! `request_conversion`, `cancel`, `reject`, `list_own_for_tenant`,
//! `list_inbound_for_parent`, and `soft_delete_resolved`. The
//! counterparty-side `approve` and the system-side `expire_pending`
//! reaper land in the next phase.
//!
//! The service depends only on the domain-level [`ConversionRepo`] and
//! [`TenantRepo`] traits. It never opens transactions itself — every
//! per-call short-lived TX is owned by the repo method
//! (`insert_pending`, `transition_pending_to_*`, etc.). The service's
//! sole responsibility is to compose guards, project parent-side rows
//! down to the minimal cross-barrier surface, and emit `am.events`
//! tracing for each successful transition.
//!
//! Test seam: a deterministic clock is injected via [`with_now_fn`].
//! Production wiring uses `OffsetDateTime::now_utc` by default; the
//! service-level unit tests pin a fixed instant so `expires_at`,
//! `resolved_at`, and the retention `cutoff` are reproducible.
