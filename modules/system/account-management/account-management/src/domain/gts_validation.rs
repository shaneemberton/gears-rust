//! GTS-runtime payload validation.
//!
//! AM resource shapes (`tenant`, `user`) are pinned by JSON Schemas
//! published under `modules/system/account-management/docs/schemas/`
//! and registered in the GTS Types Registry at deployment time. This
//! module is the single AM-side seam that fetches a resolved schema
//! from `TypesRegistryClient` and runs `jsonschema::validator_for`
//! against the supplied field values — adapting the
//! `cf-resource-group::domain::validation::validate_metadata_via_gts`
//! pattern to AM's needs with one deliberate divergence: AM maps a
//! non-not-found `TypesRegistryError` to
//! [`DomainError::ServiceUnavailable`] (HTTP 503) rather than
//! `DomainError::validation` (HTTP 400). A registry outage is an
//! infrastructure event, not a payload problem, and the 503 envelope
//! lets clients distinguish "your input is bad" from "our dependency
//! is sick" without reading the detail string.
//!
//! Unlike the resource-group helper, AM validates per-property
//! (`username`, `name`, etc.) rather than against the full instance
//! schema. The published `gts.cf.core.am.user.v1~` and
//! `gts.cf.core.am.tenant.v1~` schemas describe the resource as
//! seen on read (with required identifiers like `id`), but the
//! create-payload shapes deliberately omit those server-assigned
//! fields. Validating per-property keeps the structural bounds
//! authoritative without forcing synthetic `id` placeholders that
//! couple the helper to the schema's `required` list.
//!
//! Service layers MUST call into this module instead of hardcoding
//! length / format constants at the call site so the schema files
//! remain the single source of truth. AM business rules that are
//! *wider* than the JSON Schema (e.g. "username MUST not be
//! all-whitespace" — which the schema's `minLength: 1` does not
//! reject) stay in the service layer; this module only enforces the
//! structural contract.
//!
//! # Behaviour when a schema is not registered
//!
//! The two AM-owned schemas diverge intentionally:
//!
//! * **User schema (`gts.cf.core.am.user.v1~`)** — fail-closed.
//!   AM does NOT persist users
//!   (`cpt-cf-account-management-constraint-no-user-storage`), so a
//!   missing schema would otherwise collapse the boundary to
//!   length-only caps and silently disable `format: email` / future
//!   `pattern` rules. The same payload would be accepted before
//!   catalog registration and rejected after — a deployment cliff.
//!   The helper returns
//!   [`DomainError::ServiceUnavailable`] instead, so
//!   `provision_user` is unavailable until the operator seeds the
//!   catalog. The dependency is declared in `module.rs::deps`; treat
//!   schema-missing as a degraded-dependency signal rather than a
//!   silent passthrough.
//! * **Tenant name schema (`gts.cf.core.am.tenant.v1~`)** —
//!   short-circuits to `Ok(())`. The DB `CHECK (length(name) BETWEEN
//!   1 AND 255)` constraint is the last-line guard and bootstrap
//!   must succeed before the catalog is seeded.
//!
//! Failures fall into four categories:
//! * `validate_new_user_payload_via_gts` +
//!   `TypesRegistryError::GtsTypeSchemaNotFound` →
//!   [`DomainError::ServiceUnavailable`] (fail-closed, see above).
//! * `validate_tenant_name_via_gts` +
//!   `TypesRegistryError::GtsTypeSchemaNotFound` → `Ok(())`
//!   (DB CHECK + bootstrap-before-catalog ordering).
//! * Other `TypesRegistryError` (transport / availability) →
//!   [`DomainError::ServiceUnavailable`] for both helpers.
//! * Schema returned but `jsonschema::validator_for` rejects it →
//!   [`DomainError::Internal`] (catalog drift — operator action
//!   required).
//! * Instance fails validation against the schema →
//!   [`DomainError::Validation`] (HTTP 400 — the client can retry
//!   with a corrected payload).
//!
//! # Plugin-private metadata is opaque to AM
//!
//! Earlier revisions exposed `validate_provision_input_metadata_via_gts`
//! and `validate_provision_metadata_entries_via_gts` so AM could
//! schema-check both caller-supplied provisioning metadata and the
//! payload the `IdP` plugin returned from
//! `provision_tenant`. Both were removed when AM's contract with the
//! plugin was reshaped to treat plugin metadata as a fully opaque
//! blob persisted in `tenant_idp_metadata` and echoed back on every
//! subsequent `IdP` call. The plugin owns the shape (input and output)
//! end-to-end; AM does not interpret it.
