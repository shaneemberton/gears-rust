//! Tenant repository contract.
//!
//! `TenantRepo` is the sole storage-seam the domain layer touches. It
//! abstracts the SeaORM-backed implementation so `TenantService` can be
//! unit-tested against a pure in-memory fake.
//!
//! Trait-method shape notes:
//!
//! * Every write path that changes closure rows is expressed as a single
//!   repo method that performs the `tenants` + `tenant_closure` writes in
//!   one transaction. The service never opens a transaction itself.
//! * The `activate_tenant` method corresponds to saga step 3 from
//!   DESIGN §3.3 `seq-create-child`: flip the tenant from `provisioning`
//!   to `active` AND insert the closure rows passed by the service.
//! * `compensate_provisioning` is the clean-failure compensation path;
//!   closure cleanup is not required because no closure rows are ever
//!   written while the tenant is in `provisioning`.
//! * `update_tenant_mutable` only accepts the patchable fields (name +
//!   status) and rewrites `tenant_closure.descendant_status` atomically
//!   when `status` changes.

    /// (closure is the denormalisation, `tenants` is authoritative):
    ///
    /// * [`IntegrityCategory::MissingClosureSelfRow`] — INSERT
    ///   `(id, id, 0, status)` for tenants whose self-row is absent.
    /// * [`IntegrityCategory::ClosureCoverageGap`] — INSERT
    ///   `(ancestor, descendant, derived_barrier, status)` for missing
    ///   strict ancestors.
    /// * [`IntegrityCategory::BarrierColumnDivergence`] — UPDATE
    ///   `barrier` to the parent-walk-derived value.
    /// * [`IntegrityCategory::DescendantStatusDivergence`] — UPDATE
    ///   `descendant_status` to `tenants.status` for every row
    ///   pointing at the affected tenant.
    /// * [`IntegrityCategory::StaleClosureRow`] — DELETE rows whose
    ///   ancestry is not derivable from any in-snapshot parent walk
    ///   (missing endpoint OR ancestry not in walk).
    ///
    /// The remaining five categories (`OrphanedChild`,
    /// `BrokenParentReference`, `DepthMismatch`, `Cycle`,
    /// `RootCountAnomaly`) indicate corruption in `tenants` itself
    /// and are surfaced through
    /// [`crate::domain::tenant::integrity::RepairReport::deferred_per_category`]
    /// for operator triage — this method does NOT touch them.
    ///
    /// **Closure-only invariant**: this method NEVER writes to the
    /// `tenants` table. The pure-Rust planner in
    /// `infra/storage/integrity/repair.rs` operates over a read-only
    /// snapshot of `tenants` and emits writes targeted exclusively at
    /// `tenant_closure`.
    ///
    /// **Single-flight gate sharing**: repair acquires the same
    /// `integrity_check_runs` singleton PK as
    /// [`Self::run_integrity_check`]. Concurrent check-and-repair is
    /// meaningless (the repair would invalidate any check report
    /// produced in parallel), so they serialise on the same gate; a
    /// contender on either side surfaces
    /// [`DomainError::IntegrityCheckInProgress`].
    ///
    /// **Idempotency**: a clean snapshot returns
    /// [`RepairReport::empty`](crate::domain::tenant::integrity::RepairReport::empty)
    /// with every per-category count zero. Re-running repair on the
    /// post-repair state is a no-op — exercised by the planner-side
    /// `repair_then_repair_is_noop` test.
    ///
    /// Runs in one `SERIALIZABLE` transaction with retry — the
    /// post-snapshot apply pass MUST observe the same MVCC view the
    /// planner derived its corrections from, so concurrent saga
    /// writes that race the apply boundary surface as 40001 abort and
    /// re-plan on retry rather than producing a stale-write conflict.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// * [`DomainError::IntegrityCheckInProgress`] when another
    ///   worker holds the gate.
    /// * Any DB error from the snapshot SELECTs or the apply DML,
    ///   funnelled through the canonical
    ///   [`From<modkit_db::DbError> for DomainError`] ladder.
