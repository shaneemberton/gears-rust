//! Pure-logic retention primitives for the hard-delete pipeline.
//!
//! This module owns no I/O. The service layer (`service.rs`) drives the
//! pipeline; the repository layer (`infra/storage/repo_impl.rs`) owns the
//! SQL. What lives here is the set of algebraic helpers that both layers
//! reuse:
//!
//! * [`is_due`] — half-closed retention-window inclusion test.
//! * [`order_batch_leaf_first`] — stable leaf-first batch ordering
//!   (`depth DESC, id ASC`).
//! * [`HardDeleteOutcome`] / [`HardDeleteResult`] / [`ReaperResult`] —
//!   outcome enums + aggregate summaries emitted by the service.
//!
//! Per-tenant exponential backoff is computed by a shared helper that
//! lands together with the bootstrap saga in a later PR.
