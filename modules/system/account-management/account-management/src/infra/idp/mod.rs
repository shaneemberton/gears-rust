//! Infrastructure-layer glue for the optional
//! [`account_management_sdk::IdpPluginClient`] plugin.
//!
//! AM can boot without an `IdP` adapter present — dev deployments and
//! tests do not need one. The services store the provisioner as
//! `Arc<dyn IdpPluginClient>` directly; this module contributes
//! the [`NoopIdpProvider`] fallback wired in when no plugin resolves
//! from `ClientHub`.
//!
//! The fallback inherits every trait default, so every mutating call
//! surfaces as the category-appropriate `UnsupportedOperation` —
//! deployments without an `IdP` plugin keep booting and the call sites
//! see a consistent error envelope for both tenant and user
//! operations.
