//! `SeaORM` entity for the AM-owned `tenants` table.
//!
//! Mirrors the `tenants` schema declared by `m0001_initial_schema`
//! column-for-column and matches DESIGN §3.7. The `status` and `depth`
//! fields are stored as `SMALLINT` / `INTEGER` at the DB level but
//! surfaced through the domain layer via the
//! [`crate::domain::tenant::model::TenantStatus`] enum and a `u32` depth.
//!
//! Repository implementation and domain-to-entity mapping live in
//! `infra/storage/repo_impl/`.

// @cpt-begin:cpt-cf-account-management-dbtable-tenants:p1:inst-dbtable-tenants-entity
// `tenants` is declared `no_tenant, no_resource, no_owner, no_type` —
// no automatic AccessScope filter is applied to its reads or writes.
//
// Why: tenants is a self-owning entity (a tenant's "owner tenant" is
// itself), which doesn't fit the column-mapping model that Scopable
// declares. Mapping `tenant_col = "id"` would handle flat `Eq`/`In`
// PDP narrowing but still gets the semantics wrong (`OWNER_TENANT_ID`
// = self-id is circular) and never expresses the real cross-tenant
// authorization shape, which is **subtree clamp** — "caller can see
// tenants in their own subtree".
//
// Subtree clamp arrives through a dedicated `InTenantSubtree`
// predicate type in `authz-resolver-sdk` + `modkit-security` +
// `modkit-db secure`, mirroring the existing `InGroupSubtree` stack.
// That work is scoped as a separate PR in this stack (sits between
// the AM service PR and the Tenant Resolver Plugin PR). Until then,
// authorization for `tenants` reads is enforced by the PDP gate at
// the service layer; secure-extension auto-filtering is intentionally
// off here.
