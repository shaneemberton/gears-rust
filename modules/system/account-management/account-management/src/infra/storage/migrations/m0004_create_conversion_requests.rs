//! Migration `m0004` — create the `conversion_requests` and
//! `tenant_idp_metadata` tables that round out the AM schema for this
//! PR.
//!
//! Two tables land in the same migration because they belong to the
//! same feature slice (managed/self-managed conversion + IdP-metadata
//! isolation) and the PR has not yet shipped — there is no migration
//! ordering invariant to preserve, and the sibling `am/05-tenant-metadata`
//! branch already claims the `m0005` slot. A future PR that needs to
//! alter either table opens a new migration file rather than mutating
//! this one.
//!
//! # `conversion_requests`
//!
//! Records the durable state machine for post-creation mode changes
//! (`pending` -> `approved` | `cancelled` | `rejected` | `expired`)
//! and is wired into the rest of the schema via `FOREIGN KEY`
//! constraints on `tenants.id` for both the converting tenant
//! (`tenant_id`) and the parent linkage (`parent_id`). Both FKs
//! declare `ON DELETE CASCADE` on Postgres, but `modkit-db` does not
//! enable `PRAGMA foreign_keys` on `SQLite`, so the cascade is a
//! silent no-op there. `TenantRepoImpl::hard_delete_one` therefore
//! issues an explicit DELETE on `conversion_requests` keyed on both
//! `tenant_id` and `parent_id` inside the tenant-delete transaction
//! to keep dialect parity — mirroring the explicit cleanups already
//! used for `tenant_closure`, `tenant_metadata`, and
//! `tenant_idp_metadata`.
//!
//! # `tenant_idp_metadata`
//!
//! Plugin-private per-tenant state separated from the public
//! `tenant_metadata` table. AM persists the opaque JSON blob returned
//! by the `IdP` plugin from `IdpProvisionResult::metadata` and replays
//! it via `TenantContext::metadata` on every subsequent `IdP` call
//! for that tenant. AM does not interpret the JSON; the plugin owns
//! the shape end-to-end.
//!
//! Backend coverage: per-backend raw DDL preserves the FK +
//! `ON DELETE CASCADE` on Postgres while `SQLite` omits FK clauses
//! (FK enforcement is off by `modkit-db` convention) and relies on
//! `TenantRepoImpl::hard_delete_one` to explicit-delete
//! `tenant_idp_metadata` rows in the same transaction as the tenant
//! delete.
//!
//! No `plugin_id` column today: AM resolves at most one
//! `IdpPluginClient` from `ClientHub` per deployment, and adding the
//! column before a multi-plugin contract exists would persist a value
//! no caller actually owns.
//!
//! # Dialects + down
//!
//! Per-backend raw DDL is used so the `CHECK` invariants and the
//! partial unique index that enforces the at-most-one-pending
//! invariant on `conversion_requests` survive byte-for-byte on
//! Postgres, with a dialect-equivalent expression on `SQLite`.
//! `MySQL` is unsupported and returns
//! `DbErr::Custom(MYSQL_NOT_SUPPORTED)`.
//!
//! `down` drops both tables in reverse-creation order — FK
//! constraints (Postgres) and indexes drop together with the table on
//! each supported dialect.
