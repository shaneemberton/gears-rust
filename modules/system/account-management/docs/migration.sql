-- Reference DDL for the Account Management source-of-truth schema.
-- This file is intentionally documentation-first: implementation migrations may
-- express the same logical schema through ModKit/SeaORM migration code.
-- Dialect: PostgreSQL reference DDL.
-- Retention policy overview:
--   conversion_requests: soft-deleted (`deleted_at` stamped) by the AM retention
--     job after `resolved_retention` (default 30d) elapses past the terminal
--     status transition; hard-deleted on AM's platform retention cadence.
--   tenants: soft-deleted via `tenants.deleted_at`; hard-deleted by the
--     background tenant-hard-delete job after the tenant retention window and
--     precondition checks (no non-deleted children, no RG ownership references).
--   tenant_closure: rows for a tenant are removed only on tenant hard-delete.
--     Provisioning tenants are never present (see comment on descendant_status).

That yields 15 usable flag bits (bits 0..14); the sign bit (bit 15) is unavailable because a value with bit 15 set overflows the signed positive range and/or trips the CHECK. 15 flag bits remain ample for the multi-dimensional barrier types contemplated in TENANT_MODEL.md, and SMALLINT stays portable across PostgreSQL and MySQL without dialect-specific type mapping.

-- subsequent IdP call via `TenantContext::metadata` /
-- `IdpDeprovisionTenantRequest::tenant_context`. AM does NOT validate,
-- namespace, or interpret the JSON — the plugin owns the shape entirely.
-- No `plugin_id` column today: AM resolves at most one `IdpPluginClient`
-- per deployment; a multi-plugin disambiguator can land later together
-- with a backfill migration.

-- The state-machine enums (`status`, `initiator_side`, `target_mode`) are
-- SMALLINT-encoded for MySQL/PostgreSQL parity; int↔name translation
-- is owned by the domain layer (`ConversionStatus::as_smallint`,
-- `ConversionSide::as_smallint`, `TargetMode::as_smallint`). The
-- `child_tenant_name` + `parent_id` columns carry the dual-consent
-- request payload for parent-initiated rows that pre-create the child
-- name; same column shape on both sides of the request.
-- The actor/resolution CHECK is keyed off the SMALLINT codes and
-- forces every terminal row to stamp `resolved_at`; the pending arm
-- additionally pins `deleted_at IS NULL` so the partial-unique
-- pending index cannot be circumvented via an out-of-band soft-delete.
